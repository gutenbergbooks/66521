<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> several years I had been watching
Morocco as a man who follows the profession
of &#8216;Special Correspondent&#8217; always watches
a place that promises exciting &#8216;copy.&#8217; For
many years trouble had been brewing there.
On the Algerian frontier tribes were almost
constantly at odds with the French; in the
towns the Moors would now and then
assault and sometimes kill a European;
round about Tangier a brigand named
Raisuli repeatedly captured Englishmen and
other foreigners for the sake of ransom; and
among the Moors themselves hardly a tribe
was not at war with some other tribe or with
the Sultan. It was not, however, till July
of last year that events assumed sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
importance to make it worth the while of a
correspondent to go to Morocco. Then, as
fortune would have it, when the news came
that several Frenchmen had been killed at
Casablanca and a few days later that the
town had been bombarded by French
cruisers, I was far away in my own country.
It was ill-luck not to be in London, five days
nearer the trouble, for it was evident that
this, at last, was the beginning of a long,
tedious, sometimes unclean business, that
would end eventually&mdash;if German interest
could be worn out&mdash;in the French domination
of all North Africa west of Tripoli.</p>

<p>Sailing by the first fast steamer out of
New York I came to London, and though
late obtained a commission from the <i>Westminster
Gazette</i>. From here I went first to
Tangier, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Gibraltar; then on to Casablanca,
where I saw the destruction of an
Arab camp and also witnessed the shooting
of a party of prisoners; I visited Laraiche
against my will in a little &#8216;Scorpion&#8217; steamer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
that put in there; and finally spent some
weeks at Rabat, the war capital, after Abdul
Aziz with his extraordinary following had
come there from Fez.</p>

<p>Of these brief travels, covering all told a
period of but three months, and of events that
are passing in the Moorish Empire this little
book is a record.</p>

<p>Six letters to the <i>Westminster Gazette</i>
(forming parts of Chapters I., IV., VI., XIV.,
XV., and XVI.) are reprinted with the kind
permission of the Editor.</p>

<p class="ph1">THE PASSING OF MOROCCO</p>


<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>OUT OF GIBRALTAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was in August, 1907, one Tuesday morning,
that I landed from a P. &amp; O. steamer at
Gibraltar. I had not been there before but
I knew what to expect. From a distance of
many miles we had seen the Rock towering
above the town and dwarfing the big,
smoking men-of-war that lay at anchor at
its base. Ashore was to be seen &#8216;Tommy
Atkins,&#8217; just as one sees him in England,
walking round with a little cane or standing
stiff with bayonet fixed before a tall kennel,
beside him, as if for protection, a &#8216;Bobbie.&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
The Englishman is everywhere in evidence,
always to be recognised, if not otherwise, by
his stride&mdash;which no one native to these
parts could imitate. The Spaniard of the
Rock (whom the British calls contemptuously
&#8216;Scorpion&#8217;) is inclined to be polite and even
gracious, though he struggles against his
nature in an attempt to appear &#8216;like English.&#8217;
Moors from over the strait pass through the
town and leisurely observe, without envying,
the <i>Nasrani</i> power, then pass on again,
seeming always to say: &#8216;No, this is not
my country; I am Moslem.&#8217; Gibraltar is
thoroughly British. Even the Jews, sometimes
in long black gaberdines, seem foreign
to the place. And though on the plastered
walls of Spanish houses are often to be seen
announcements of bull fights at Cordova and
Seville, the big advertisements everywhere
are of such well-known British goods as
&#8216;Tatcho&#8217; and &#8216;Dewar&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>

<p>I have had some wonderful views of the
Rock of Gibraltar while crossing on clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
days from Tangier, and these I shall never
forget, but I think I should not like the
town. No one associates with the Spaniards,
I am told, and the other Europeans, I
imagine, are like fish out of water. They
seem to be of but two minds: those longing
to get back to England, and those who never
expect to live at home again. Most of the
latter live and trade down the Moorish
coast, and come to &#8216;Gib&#8217; on holidays once or
twice a year, to buy some clothes, to see a
play, to have a &#8216;spree.&#8217; Of course they are
not &#8216;received&#8217; by the others, those who long
for England, who are &#8216;exclusive&#8217; and deign
to meet with only folk who come from
home. In the old days, when the Europeans
in Morocco were very few, it was not unusual
for the lonesome exile to take down the
coast with him from &#8216;Gib&#8217; a woman who was
&#8216;not of the marrying brand.&#8217; She kept his
house and sometimes bore him children.
Usually after a while he married her, but
in some instances not till the children had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
grown and the sons in turn began to go to
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>My first stop at the Rock was for only an
hour, for I was anxious to get on to Tangier,
and the little &#8216;Scorpion&#8217; steamer that plied
between the ports, the <i>Gibel Dursa</i>, sailed
that Tuesday morning at eleven o&#8217;clock. I
seemed to be the only cabin passenger, but
on the deck were many Oriental folk and
low-caste Spaniards, not uninteresting fellow-travellers.
Though the characters of the
North African and the South Spaniard are
said to be alike, in appearance there could be
no greater contrast, the one lean and long-faced,
the other round-headed and anxious
always to be fat. Neither are they at all
alike in style of dress, and I had occasion to
observe a peculiar difference in their code of
manners. I had brought aboard a quantity
of fresh figs and pears, more than I could
eat, and I offered some to a hungry-looking
Spaniard, who watched me longingly; but
he declined. On the other hand a miserable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Arab to whom I passed them at once
accepted and salaamed, though he told me
by signs that he was not accustomed to the
sea and had eaten nothing since he left
Algiers. As I moved away, leaving some
figs behind, I kept an eye over my shoulder,
and saw the Spaniard pounce upon them.</p>

<p>The conductor, or, as he would like to be
dignified, the purser, of the ship, necessarily
a linguist, was a long, thin creature, sprung
at the knees and sunk at the stomach. He
was of some outcast breed of Moslem. Pock-marked
and disfigured with several scars, his
appearance would have been repulsive were
it not grotesque. None of his features
seemed to fit. His lips were plainly negro,
his nose Arabian, his ears like those of an
elephant; I could not see his eyes, covered
with huge goggles, black enough to pale his
yellow face. Nor was this creature dressed
in the costume of any particular race. In
place of the covering Moorish <i>jeleba</i> he wore
a white duck coat with many pockets. Stockings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
covered his calves, leaving only his
knees, like those of a Scot, visible below full
bloomers of dark-green calico. On his feet
were boots instead of slippers. Of course
this man was noisy; no such mongrel could
be quiet. He argued with the Arabs and
fussed with the Spaniards, speaking to each
in their own language. On spying me he
came across the ship at a jump, grabbed my
hand and shook it warmly. He was past-master
at the art of identification. Though all
my clothes including my hat and shoes had
come from England&mdash;and I had not spoken
a word&mdash;he said at once, &#8216;You &#8217;Merican
man,&#8217; adding, &#8216;No many &#8217;Merican come
Tangier now; &#8217;fraid <i>Jehad</i>&#8217;&mdash;religious war.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah, you speak English,&#8217; I said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, me speak Englis&#8217; vera well: been
&#8217;Merica long time&mdash;Chicago, New&#8217;leans,
San &#8217;Frisco, Balt&#8217;more, N&#8217;York&#8217; (he pronounced
this last like a native). &#8216;Me been
Barnum&#8217;s Circus.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Were you the menagerie?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>The fellow was insulted. &#8216;No,&#8217; he replied
indignantly, &#8216;me was freak.&#8217;</p>

<p>Later when I had made my peace with
him by means of a sixpence I asked to be
allowed to take his picture, at which he was
much flattered and put himself to the trouble
of donning a clean coat; though, in order that
no other Mohammedan should see and vilify
him, he would consent to pose only on the
upper-deck.</p>

<p>Sailing from under the cloud about Gibraltar
the skies cleared rapidly, and in less
than half-an-hour the yellow hills of the shore
across the strait shone brilliantly against a
clear blue sky. There was no mistaking this
bit of the Orient. For an hour we coasted
through the deep green waters. Before
another had passed a bleak stretch of sand,
as from the Sahara, came down to the sea;
and there beyond, where the yellow hills
began again, was the city of Tangier, the
outpost of the East. A mass of square,
almost windowless houses, blue and white,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
climbing in irregular steps, much like the
&#8216;Giant&#8217;s Causeway,&#8217; to the walls of the ancient
<i>Kasbah</i>, with here and there a square green
minaret or a towering palm.</p>

<p>We dropped anchor between a Spanish
gunboat and the six-funnelled cruiser <i>Jeanne
d&#8217;Arc</i>, amid a throng of small boats rowed
by Moors in coloured bloomers, their legs
and faces black and white and shades between.
While careful to keep company with my luggage,
I managed at the same time to embark
in the first boat, along with the mongrel in
the goggles and a veiled woman with three
children, as well as others. Standing to row
and pushing their oars, the bare-legged boatmen
took us rapidly towards the landing&mdash;then
to stop within a yard of the pier and
for a quarter of an hour haggle over fares.
Three reals Moorish was all they could
extort from the Spaniards, and this was the
proper tariff; but from me two pesetas, three
times as much, was exacted. I protested,
and got the explanation, through the man of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
many tongues, that this was the regulation
charge for &#8216;landing&#8217; Americans. In this
country, he added from his own full knowledge,
the rich are required to pay double
where the poor cannot. While the Spaniards,
the freak and I climbed up the steps to the pier,
several boatmen, summoned from the quay,
came wading out and took the woman and her
children on their backs, landing them beyond
the gate where pier-charges of a real are paid.</p>

<p>At the head of the pier a rickety shed of
present-day construction, supported by an
ancient, crumbling wall, is the custom-house.
Not in anticipation of difficulty here, but as
a matter of precaution, I had stuffed into
my pockets (knowing that my person could
not be searched) my revolver and a few
books; and to hide these I wore a great-coat
and sweltered in it. Perhaps from my appearance
the cloaked Moors, instead of
realising the true reason, only considered me
less mad than the average of my kind. At
any rate they &#8216;passed&#8217; me bag and baggage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
with a most superficial examination and not
the suggestion that <i>backsheesh</i> would be
acceptable.</p>

<p>But on another day I had a curious experience
at this same custom-house. A
new kodak having followed me from London
was held for duty, which should be, according
to treaty, ten per cent. <i>ad valorem</i>. It was
in no good humour that after an hour&#8217;s
wrangling I was finally led into a room with
a long rough table at the back and four
spectacled, grey-bearded Moors in white
<i>kaftans</i> and turbans seated behind.</p>

<p>&#8216;How much?&#8217; I asked and a Frenchman
translated.</p>

<p>&#8216;Four dollars,&#8217; came the reply.</p>

<p>&#8216;The thing is only worth four pounds
twenty dollars; I&#8217;ll give you one dollar.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Make it three&mdash;three dollars, Hassani.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, one.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Make it two&mdash;two dollars Spanish.&#8217;</p>

<p>This being the right tax, I paid. But I
was not to get my goods yet; what was my
name?</p>

<p>&#8216;No, <i>your</i> name.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I presented my card.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Moore!&#8217; A laugh went down the turbaned
line.</p>

<p>A writer on the East has said of the
Moors that they are the Puritans of Islam,
and the first glimpse of Morocco will attest
the truth of this. Not a Moor has laid aside
the <i>jeleba</i> and the corresponding headgear,
turban or fez. In the streets of Tangier&mdash;of
all Moorish towns the most &#8216;contaminated&#8217;
with Christians&mdash;there is not a tramway or
a hackney cab. Not a railway penetrates
the country anywhere, not a telegraph, nor
is there a postal service. Except for the
discredited Sultan (whose ways have precipitated
the disruption of the Empire) not a
Moor has tried the improvements of Europe.
It seems extraordinary that such a country
should be the &#8216;Farthest West of Islam&#8217; and
should face the Rock of Gibraltar.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>NIGHTS ON A ROOF</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I did</span> not stop long on this occasion at
Tangier, because, from a newspaper point
of view, Casablanca was a place of more
immediate interest. The night before I
sailed there arrived an old Harvard friend
travelling for pleasure, and he proposed to
accompany me. Johnny Weare was a young
man to all appearances accustomed to good
living, and friends of an evening&mdash;easy to
acquire at Tangier&mdash;advised him to take
a supply of food. But I unwisely protested
and dissuaded John, and we went down
laden with little unnecessary luggage, travelling
by a French torpedo-boat conveying
despatches.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Here I must break my story in order to
make it complete, and anticipate our arrival
at Casablanca with an account of how the
French army happened to be lodged in this
Moorish town. In 1906 a French company
obtained a contract from the Moorish
Government to construct a harbour at Casablanca;
and beginning work they found it
expedient, in order to bring up the necessary
stone and gravel, to lay a narrow-gauge
railway to a quarry a few miles down
the coast. In those Mohammedan countries
where the dead are protected from &#8216;Infidel&#8217;
tread the fact that the tracks bordered close
on a cemetery, in fact passed over several
graves, would have been cause perhaps for a
conflict; but this&mdash;though enemies of France
have tried to proclaim it&mdash;was not a serious
matter in Morocco, where the Moslems are
done with their dead when they bury them
and anyone may walk on the graves. The
French were opposed solely because they
were Christian invaders to whom the Sultan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
had &#8216;sold out.&#8217; They had bought the High
Shereef with their machines and their
money, but the tribes did not intend to
tolerate them.</p>

<p>After many threats the Arabs of the
country came to town one market-day prepared
for war. Gathering the local Moors,
including those labouring on the railway,
they surrounded and killed in brutal fashion,
with sticks and knives and the butts of guns,
the engineer of the locomotive and eight other
French and Italian workmen. The French
cruiser <i>Galil&eacute;e</i> was despatched to the scene,
and arriving two days later lay in harbour
apparently awaiting instructions from home.
By this delay the Moors, though quiet, were
encouraged, hourly becoming more convinced
that if the French could land they
would have done so. They were thoroughly
confident, as their resistance demonstrated,
when, after three days, a hundred marines
were put ashore. As the marines passed
through the &#8216;Water Port&#8217; they were fired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
upon by a single Moor, and thereupon they
shot at every cloaked man that showed his
head on their march of half-a-mile to the
French consulate. At the sound of rifles the
<i>Galil&eacute;e</i> began bombarding the Moslem
quarters of the town; and the stupid Moorish
garrison, with guns perhaps brought out
of Spain, essayed to reply, and lasted for
about ten minutes.</p>

<p>But the landing force of the French was
altogether too small to do more than protect
the French consulate and neighbouring
European houses. Town Moors and Arabs
turned out to kill and rape and loot, as they
do whenever opportunity offers, and for
three days they plundered the places of
Europeans and Jews and at last fought
among themselves for the spoils until driven
from the town by reinforcements of French
and Spanish troops.</p>

<p>The fighting and the shells from French
ships had laid many bodies in the streets
and had wrecked many houses and some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
mosques. Certain Moors, less ignorant of
the French power, had asked the French
to spare the mosques and the &#8216;Saint
Houses,&#8217; domed tombs of dead shereefs,
and when the fighting began the Arabs,
seeing these places were untouched, concluded,
of course, that the protection came
from Allah, until they entered them and
drew the French fire.</p>

<p>Casablanca, or, as the Arabs call it, <i>Dar el
Baida</i>, &#8216;White House,&#8217; was a desolate-looking
place when we arrived three weeks after
the bombardment. Hardly a male Moor was
to be seen. The whole Moslem population,
with the exception of a few men of wealth
who enjoy European protection, and some
servants of consulates, had deserted the town
and had not yet begun to return. Jews in
black caps and baggy trousers were the only
labourers, and they worked with a will
recovering damaged property at good pay,
and grinning at their good fortune. In the
attack the Moors had driven them to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
boats, but now the Moors themselves had
had to go. Native Spaniards did the lighter
work.</p>

<p>A Spaniard and a Jewish boy took our
luggage to an hotel, of which all the rooms
were already occupied, even to the bathroom
and the wine closet, as the long zinc tub in
the courtyard, filled with bottles, testified.
The proprietor told us that for ten francs a
day we might have the dining-room to sleep
in, but on investigation we decided to hunt
further. Speaking Spanish with a grand
manner, for he was a cavalier fellow, the
hotel-keeper then informed us through an
interpreter that he wanted to do what he could
for us because he too was an American.
The explanation (for which we asked) was
that in New York he had a brother whom
he had once visited for a few months, and
that at that time, &#8216;to favour an American
gentleman,&#8217; he had taken out naturalisation
papers and voted for the mayor.</p>

<p>But this man&#8217;s breach of the law in New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
York was his mildest sin, as we came later
to hear. He had many robberies to his
credit and a murder or two. For his latest
crime he was now wanted by the French
consul and military authorities, but being an
American citizen they could not lay hold of
him except with the consent of the American
consul, who happened to be a German,
and, disliking the French, would let them do
nothing that he could help. Rodrigues (this
was the name of the Spanish <i>caballero</i>) had
defended his place against the Arab attack
with the aid only of his servants. The
little arsenal which he kept (he was a
fancier of good guns and pistols) had been of
splendid service. It is said that when the
fight was over forty dead Moors lay before
the hotel door, half-a-dozen horses were in
Rodrigues&#8217;s stable, and bundles of plunder in
his yard. It was a case of looting the looters.
On tinned foods taken from the shops of
other Europeans (whom he had plundered
when the Arabs were gone from the town)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
he was now feeding the host of newspaper
correspondents who crowded his establishment.
But we were not to be looted likewise
by this genial fellow-countryman, and
our salvation lay at hand as we bade him <i>au
revoir</i>.</p>

<p>Leaving the H&ocirc;tel Am&eacute;ricain we turned
into the main street, and proceeding towards
the H&ocirc;tel Continental came upon a party of
French officers, who had just hailed and
were shaking hands with a man unmistakably
either English or American. Beside him,
even in their military uniforms the Frenchmen
were insignificant. The other man was
tall and splendid and brave, as the writer
of Western fiction would say. He wore a
khaki jacket, white duck riding trousers,
English leggings, and a cowboy hat; and
over one shoulder were slung a rifle, a kodak,
and a water-bottle. To lend reality to the
figure&mdash;he was dusty, and his collar was undone;
and as we passed the group we heard
him tell the Frenchmen he had just returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
from the &#8216;outer lines.&#8217; How often had we
seen the picture of this man, the war correspondent
of fiction and of kodak advertisements!</p>

<p>Both Weare and I were glad to meet the
old familiar friend in the flesh and wanted to
speak to him, but we refrained for fear he
might be English and might resent American
effrontery. As we passed him, however, we
noticed his name across the flat side of the
water-bottle. In big, bold letters was the
inscription: &#8216;Captain Squall, Special War
Correspondent of &#8220;The Morning Press.&#8221;&#8217;
This was characteristic of Squall, as we came
to know; neither &#8216;special correspondent&#8217; nor
&#8216;war correspondent&#8217; was a sufficient title
for him; he must be &#8216;special war correspondent.&#8217;</p>

<p>We had heard of Squall at Tangier and
thought we could stop and speak to him, and
accordingly waited a moment till he had
left the Frenchmen. &#8216;How-do-you-do, Captain?&#8217;
I said. &#8216;I have an introduction to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
you in my bag from the correspondent of
your paper at Tangier.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re an American,&#8217; was the Captain&#8217;s
first remark, not a very novel observation;
&#8216;I&#8217;ve been in America a good deal myself.&#8217;
He adjusted a monocle and explained with
customary originality that he had one bad
eye. &#8216;What do you think of my &#8220;stuff&#8221; in
the Press?&#8217; was his next remark.</p>

<p>&#8216;A little personal, isn&#8217;t it? I read that
despatch about your being unable to get any
washing done at the hotel because of scarcity
of water, and your leaving it for that reason.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, that&#8217;s what the British public like to
read, personal touches, don&#8217;t you think?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where are you living now? We
have to find a place.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come with me. You know the Americans
were always very hospitable to me, and
I like to have a chance to do them a good
turn. I&#8217;m living on a roof and getting my
own grub. You know I&#8217;m an old campaigner&mdash;I
mean to say, I&#8217;ve been in South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Africa, and on the Canadian border, and I
got my chest smashed in by a Russian in the
Japanese war,&mdash;I mean a hand to hand conflict,
you know, using the butts of our guns.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Were you a correspondent out there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, I was fighting for the Japs; I&#8217;m a
soldier of fortune, you know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But the Japanese Government did not
allow Europeans to enlist.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I was the only one they would enlist; I
mean to say, my father had some influence
with the Japanese minister in London.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But you&#8217;re very young; how old are
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I don&#8217;t like to say; I mean there&#8217;s
a reason I can&#8217;t tell my age,&mdash;I mean, I
went to South Africa when I was sixteen;
you see that&#8217;s under age for military service
in the British Army.&#8217; The Captain waited
a moment, then started off again. &#8216;I&#8217;ve got
medals from five campaigns.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d like to see them.&#8217;</p>

<p>Indifferently he opened his jacket.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8216;There are six,&#8217; I remarked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s not a campaign medal; that&#8217;s
a medal of the Legion of Frontiersmen. I
mean to say, I was one of the organisers of
that.&#8217;</p>

<p>Weare and I recognised the type.
There are many of them abroad and some
wear little American flags. But, of course,
to us they are more grotesque when they
affect the monocle. We knew Squall would
not be insulted if we turned the conversation
to the matter of most interest to us at that
moment.</p>

<p>&#8216;For my part,&#8217; said Weare, &#8216;I could do
well with something to eat just now. One
doesn&#8217;t eat much on a torpedo-boat.&#8217;</p>

<p>With the prospects of our companionship&mdash;for
Squall was boycotted by most of the
correspondents&mdash;he led us away to his roof
to get us a meal; and, for what the town provided,
a good meal he served us. He did
his own cooking, but he did it because he
liked to cook,&mdash;he meant to say, he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
money coming to him from the sale of a
motor-car in London, and he had just lost
fifteen or twenty thousand pounds&mdash;the exact
amount did not matter either to us or to him.</p>

<p>For a fortnight, till an old American
resident of Casablanca invited us to his
house, we suffered Squall. We three slept
on the roof while a decrepit, dirty Spaniard,
the owner of the place, slept below. It was
a modest, one-storey house, built in Moorish
style. There were rooms on four sides of a
paved courtyard, under a slab in the centre
of which was the customary well. Overhead
a covering of glass, now much broken, was
intended to keep out the rain. The place
had been looted by the Moors, who took
away the few things of any value and
destroyed the rest, leaving the room littered
with torn clothes and bedding and broken
furniture, if I might dignify the stuff by these
names; nor had the old man (whose family
had escaped to Tangier) cleared out any
place but the kitchen and the courtyard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>There was a little slave boy whose master
had been killed, and who now served a
&#8216;Mister Peto&#8217; and came to us for water every
day. As our old Spaniard would not keep
the place clean and saved all the food that
we left from meals (which filled the place
with flies) we hired the boy for a peseta,
about a franc, a day to keep it clean. He
was to get nothing at all if he allowed in
more than twenty-five flies, and for one day
he worked well and got the money. But
the reason of his success was the presence all
that day of one or the other of us engaged
at writing, protecting him from the wrath of
the old man, who resented being deprived of
both stench and flies. The next day when
we returned from the French camp there
was no more black boy, and we never saw
him again, nor could we ascertain from the
old man what had happened to him. Thereafter
we never drew a bucket of drinking
water from the well without the fear of bringing
up a piece of poor &#8216;Sandy.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>As candles were scarce and bad we went
to bed early. Weare and I generally retiring
first. We climbed the rickety, ladder-like
stairs and walked round the glass square
over the courtyard to the side of the roof
where cooling breezes blew from the Atlantic.
There undressing, we rolled our clothes in
tight bundles and put them under our heads
for pillows. To lie on we had only sacking,
for our rain-coats had to be used as covering
to keep off the heavy dews of the early
morning. Only Squall had a hammock.</p>

<p>Before retiring every evening Squall had
the task of examining and testing his weapons,
of which he had enough for us all. A
&#8216;Webley&#8217; and &#8216;Colt&#8217; were not sufficient,
he must also bring to the roof his rifle, on
the butt of which were fourteen notches, one
for each Moor he had shot. He clanked up
the steps like Long John, the pirate, coming
from &#8216;below,&#8217; in &#8216;Treasure Island.&#8217; When
he had got into the hammock, lying comfortably
on revolvers and cartridge belts, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
gun within reach against the wall, he would
begin to talk. &#8216;You chaps think I bring all
these &#8220;shooting-irons&#8221; up here because I&#8217;m
afraid of something. Only look at what I&#8217;ve
been through. I&#8217;ve got over being afraid.
The reason I bring them all up with me is
that I don&#8217;t want them stolen,&mdash;I mean to
say there isn&#8217;t any lock on the door, you
know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Go to sleep, Squall.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I mean you chaps haven&#8217;t got any
business talking about me being afraid.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can&#8217;t you tell us about it at breakfast,
Squall?&#8217;</p>

<p>One night Squall wanted to borrow a
knife; his, he said, was not very sharp. He
had been out &#8216;on the lines&#8217; that day, and he
wanted it, he explained, to put another notch
in his gun.</p>

<p>Sometimes a patrol would pass in the
night, and we would hear the three pistols
and the gun click. Once the gun went off.</p>

<p>At daybreak we would rouse old Squall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
to go and make coffee, and while he was
thus employed we were entertained by the
occupants of a &#8216;kraal&#8217; (I can think of no
better description) next door. In a little,
low hut, built of reeds and brush, directly
under our roof, lived a dusky mother and
her daughter. The one (I imagine) was a
widow, the other an unmarried though
mature maid. They were among the score
of Moors who had not fled, and there being
no men of their own race about they were
not afraid to show their faces to us. The
mother was a hag, but the younger woman
was splendid, big and broad-shouldered, with
a deep chest. Her colour was that of an
Eastern gipsy, bronze as if sunburned, with
a slight red in her cheeks; she was black-haired,
and she always wore a flower. From
her lower lip to her chin was a double line
tattooed in blue, and about her ankles and
arms, likewise tattooed, were broad blue
bangles, one above her elbow. The clothes
that she wore, though of common cotton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
were brilliant in colour, generally bright
green or blue or orange-yellow, sometimes a
combination; they were not made into garments
but rather draped about her, as is the
way in Morocco, and held together with
gaudy metal ornaments. Two bare feet,
slippered in red, and one bare arm and
shoulder were always visible. While this
younger woman cooked in the open yard,
and the old crone lean and haggard watched,
they would look up from their kettle from
time to time and speak to us in language we
could not understand. We threw them small
coins and they offered us tea. But we did
not visit the ladies, to run the risk, perhaps,
of dissipating an illusion.</p>

<p>&#8216;Coffee, you chaps,&#8217; sounded from below,
and we went down to breakfast with good
old &#8216;Blood-stained Bill.&#8217;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>DEAD MEN AND DOGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> at times unpleasant, it is always
interesting to come upon the scene of a recent
battle. Casablanca had been a battlefield of
unusual order. The fight that had taken
place was not large or momentous, but it
had peculiarities of its own, and it left some
curious wreckage. Windowless Moorish
houses with low arched doors now lay open,
the corners knocked off or vast holes rent in
the side, and any man might enter. Several
&#8216;Saint Houses&#8217; were also shattered, and a
mosque near the Water Port had been
deserted to the &#8216;infidels.&#8217; The French guns
had done great damage, but how could they
have missed their mark at a range of less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
than a mile! A section of the town had
taken fire and burned. One cluster of dry
brush kraals had gone up like so much paper
and was now a heap of fine ash rising like
desert sand to every breeze. Another quarter
of a considerable area was untouched by fire,
though not by the hand of the Arab; and
what he had left of pots and pans and other
poor utensils the Spaniard and Jew had
gathered after his departure. At the time
that we came poking through the quarter
only a tom-tom, and that of inferior clay with
a broken drum, was to be found. Hut after
hut we entered through mazes of twisting
alleys, the gates down everywhere or wide
ajar; and we found in every case a heap of
rags picked over half-a-dozen times, a heap
of earthenware broken to bits by the Moors
in order that no one else might profit. So
silent was this quarter, once the living place
of half the Moorish population, that the
shimmering of the sun upon the roofs seemed
almost audible. Twice we came upon Algerians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
of the French army, in one case two
men, in the other a single stalwart &#8216;Tirailleur.&#8217;
We came to a street of wooden huts a little
higher than the kraals, the <i>sok</i> or market-place
of the neighbourhood. Invariably the
doors had been barricaded, and invariably
holes hacked with axes had been made to let
in the arm, or, if the shop was more than
four feet square, the body of the looter. In
front of the holes were little heaps of things
discarded and smashed. What fiends these
Moors and Arabs are, in all their mad haste
to have taken the time to destroy what they
did not want or what they could not carry
off! They had hurried about the streets
robbing each others&#8217; bodies and dressing
themselves, hot as the season was, in all the
clothes they could crowd on, shedding ragged
garments when they came to newer ones,
always taking the trouble to destroy the old.
And I have heard that in collecting women
they acted much in the same way, leaving
one woman for another, &#8216;going partners,&#8217; one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
man guarding while the other gathered,
driving the women off at last like cattle,
for women among Mohammedans have a
definite market value.</p>

<p>Though the bodies were now removed
from the streets it was evident from the
stench that some still lay amongst the wreckage.
Flies, great blue things, buzzed everywhere,
rising in swarms as we passed, to
settle again on the wasted sugar or the filthy
rubbish and the clots of blood. Emaciated
cats and swollen dogs roused from sleep and
slunk away noiselessly at our approach. One
dog, as we entered a house through a hole
torn by a shell, rose and gave one loud bark,
but, seeming to frighten himself, he then
backed before us, viciously showing his teeth,
though growling almost inaudibly. Evidently
he belonged to the house. At the fall of
night these dogs&mdash;I often watched them&mdash;would
pass in packs, silently like jackals, out
to the fields beyond the French and Spanish
camps, where the bigger battles had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
place and where a dead Moor or a French
artillery horse dried by the sun lay here
and there unburied.</p>

<p>The return of the Moors to the wrecks of
their homes began about the time of our
arrival. At first there came in only two or
three wretched-looking creatures, bare-footed
and bare-headed, clad usually in a single
shirt which dragged about their dirty legs,
robbed of everything, in some cases even
their wives gone. As the Arabs of the
country sought in every way, even to the
extent of shooting them, to prevent their
surrender, they were compelled to run the
gauntlet at night; and often at night the
flashes of the Arabs&#8217; guns could be seen
from the camp of the French. The miserable
Moors who got away lay most of the night in
little groups outside the wire entanglements
till their white flag, generally the tail of a
shirt, was seen by the soldiers at daybreak.
The Moors who thus surrendered, after being
searched for weapons, were taken for examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
to the office of the general&#8217;s staff, a
square brush hut in the centre of the French
camp, where, under a row of fig trees, they
awaited their turns. Some Jews among
them, refugees from the troubled villages
round about, were careful in even this their
day to keep a distance from the elect of
Mohammed, remaining out in the blinding
sun till a soldier of &#8216;the Legion&#8217; told them
also to get into the shade. The Jews were
given bread by their sympathisers, and they
went in first to be questioned because their
examination was not so rigorous as that
through which the Moors were put&mdash;humble
pie this for the Moors!</p>

<p>When a Moor entered the commander&#8217;s
office he prostrated himself, as he would do
usually only to his Sultan or some holy
man of his creed; however, he was ordered
to rise and go squat in a corner. An
officer who spoke Arabic&mdash;and sometimes
carried a riding-crop&mdash;drew up a chair, sat
over him and put him through an inquisition;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
and if he showed the slightest insolence a
blow or two across the head soon quelled his
spirit. When the examination was over,
however, and the Moor had been sufficiently
humiliated, the French were lenient enough.
The man&#8217;s name was recorded and he was
then permitted to return to his home and to
resume his trade in peace. He received
sometimes a pass, and, if he could do so in
the teeth of his watchful countrymen outside
the barriers, he went back into the interior to
fetch such of his women folk as were safe.
But every idle Moor was taken from the
streets and made to work as it is not in his
belief that he should&mdash;though he was fed and
paid a pittance for his labour. Medical
attention was to be had, though the Mohammedan
would not ordinarily avail himself of
the Nazarene remedies.</p>

<p>I should say the French were just, even
kindly, to the Moors who surrendered without
arms but to those taken in battle they
showed no mercy. The French army returning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
from an engagement never brought in
prisoners, and neither men nor officers kept
the fact a secret that those they took they
slaughtered.</p>

<p>The French spread terror in the districts
round about, and after they began to penetrate
the country and leave in their wake a
trail of death and desolation, the leaders of
several tribes near to Casablanca came in to
sue for peace. These were picturesque men
with bushed black hair sticking out sometimes
six inches in front of their ears.
The older of them and those less poorly off
came on mules, the youth on horses. They
saw General Drude and the French consul,
and went away again to discuss with the
other tribesmen the terms that could be had:
no arms within ten miles of Casablanca and
protection of caravans bound hither. But
soon it came to be known that the sorties of
the French were limited to a zone apparently
of fifteen kilom&egrave;tres, and the spirit of the
Arabs rose and they became again defiant.</p>

<small>WITH THE FOREIGN LEGION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was to see the war balloon go up that I
planned with a youthful wag of a Scot to rise
at five o&#8217;clock one morning and walk out to
the French lines before breakfast. He came
to the roof and got me up, and we passed
through the ruined streets, over the fallen
bricks and mortar, to the outer gate, the
<i>Bab-el-Sok</i>. Arriving in the open, the
balloon appeared to us already, to our
surprise, high in the air; and on the straight
road that divided the French camp we
noticed a thick, lifting cloud of brown dust.
Lengthening our stride we pushed on as
fast as the heavy sand would allow, passing
the camp and overtaking the trail of dust
just as the last cavalry troop of the picturesque
French army turned out through
an opening in the wire entanglements which
guarded the town. General Drude did not
inform correspondents when he proposed an
attack.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_038b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">AN ALGERIAN SPAHI.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Spread out in front of us on the bare,
rolling country was a moving body of men
forming a more or less regular rectangle, of
which the front and rear were the short
ends, about half as long as the sides. The
outer lines were marked by companies of
infantry, bloomered Tirailleurs and the
Foreign Legion, marching in open order,
often single file, with parallel lines at the
front and vital points. Within the rectangle
travelled the field artillery, three sections of
two guns each; a mountain battery, carried
dismantled on mules; a troop of Algerian
cavalry; the general and his staff; and a
brigade of the Red Cross. Outside the
main body, flung a mile to the front and far
off either wing, scattered detachments of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
<i>Goumiers</i>, in flowing robes, served as scouts.
Already three of them on the sky-line, by
the position of their horses, signalled that the
way was clear.</p>

<p>This little army, counting in its ranks
Germans, Arabs, and negroes, as well as
native Frenchmen, numbered all told less
than three thousand men. It had got into
fighting formation under shelter of a battery
and two short flanking lines of infantry
lodged on the first ridge; and passing
through the wire entanglements the various
detachments had found their positions without
a halt. The force, even though small,
was well handled, and the men were keen
for the advance. Of course they were
thoroughly confident; they might have been
recklessly so but for the controlling hand of
the cautious general.</p>

<p>Finding ourselves at a rear corner of the
block we set our speed at about double
that of the columns of the troops and took
a general direction diagonally towards a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
section of the artillery, now kicking up a
pretty dust as it dragged through the
ploughed fields. Overtaking the guns
we slogged on with them for a mile or
more, advising the officers not to waste their
camera films, as they seemed inclined to do,
before the morning clouds disappeared.</p>

<p>The helmets of the artillerymen and
<i>L&eacute;gionnaires</i> hid their faces and made them
look like British soldiers; and this was disappointing,
to find that the only French
troops in the army had left behind in camp
the little red caps that give them the
appearance of belonging to the time of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>Though inside us we carried no breakfast,
neither were we laden with doughy
bread and heavy water-bottles, to say
nothing of rifles; and after a short breathing
spell and a ride on the guns we were
soon able to say <i>au revoir</i> to the battery
and to press on ahead. Our eagerness to
ascertain the object of the movement led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
us towards the general&#8217;s staff; but we did
not get there. The little man with the big
moustache spied us at some distance and
sent an officer to say that correspondents
should keep back with the hospital corps.
Thinking perhaps it would be best not to
argue this point, we thanked the officer, sent
our compliments to Monsieur le G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
Drude, and dropped back till the artillery
hid us from his view, grateful that he had
not sent an orderly with us.</p>

<p>It was only four miles out from Casablanca,
as the front line came to the crest of
the second rise, that the firing began. About
half a mile ahead of us we saw the forward
guns go galloping up the slope and swing
into position; and a minute later two screeching
shells went flying into the distance. A
battery to the left was going rapidly to the
front, and, keeping an eye on the general,
we made over to it and passed to the far
side, to be out of his view. It happened
that by so doing we also took the shelter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the battery from a feeble Moorish fire, and
our apparent anxiety brought down upon us
the chaff of the soldiers. But we did not
offer to explain. With this battery we went
forward to the firing line; and as soon as
the guns were in action, the Scot, forgetting
the fight in the interest of his own mission,
began dodging in and out among the busy
artillerists, snapping pictures of them in action.
Though the men kept to their work, several
of the officers had time to pose for a picture,
and one smart-looking young fellow on horseback
rode over from the other battery to
draw up before the camera. All went well
till the general, stealing a march on us, came
up behind on foot. I do not know exactly
what he said, as I do not catch French shouted
rapidly, but I shall not forget the picture he
made. Standing with his legs apart, his
arms shaking in the air, his cap on the back
of his head, the little man in khaki not only
frightened us with his rage but made liars of
his officers. The same men who had posed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
for us now turned upon us in a most outrageous
manner. Some of them, I am sure,
used &#8216;cuss&#8217; words, which fortunately not
understanding we did not have to resent;
several called us imbeciles, and one threatened
to put us under arrest.</p>

<p>&#8216;There,&#8217; said the Scot as the general
turned his wrath upon his officers, &#8216;that will
make a splendid picture, &#8220;A Critical Moment
on the Battlefield; General Drude foaming
at his Staff.&#8221; Won&#8217;t you ask them to pose
a minute?&#8217;</p>

<p>We moved back a hundred yards, taking
the shelter of a battered Saint House, and
began to barter with some soldiers for something
to eat. For three cigarettes apiece
four of them were willing to part with a two-inch
cube of stringy meat and a slab of soggy
brown bread, with a cupful of water. As we
sat at breakfast with these fellows their
officers got out kodaks and photographed
the group, perhaps desiring to show the
contrast of civilians in Panama hats beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
their bloomered, fezzed Algerians. With
still a hunk of bread to be masticated we had
to rise and go forward. All of the army
ahead of us moved off and the reserves took
up a position on the ridge the cannon had
just occupied. As soon as the general took
his departure we began to look about for
some protecting line of men or mules, but
there were none following him. The rectangle
had divided into two squares, and we were
with the second, which would remain where it
was. The object of this man&#339;uvre was to
entice the Moors into the breach, they thinking
to cut off the first square and to be
caught between the two. But the Moors
had had their lesson at this game three
weeks before.</p>

<p>Realising soon that we were with the
passive force we resolved to overtake the
Foreign Legion, now actively engaged, and
accordingly set out across the valley after
them for a two-mile chase. A caravan track
led down through gullies and trailed in and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
out, round earth mounds and &#8216;Saint Houses,&#8217;
often cutting us off from the view of both
forces at the same time, and once hiding from
us even the balloon. Crossing a trodden
grain-field to shorten our distance we came
upon three Arabs, dead or dying, a dead
horse, and the scatterings of a shell. A lean
old brown man, with a thin white beard and
a shaven head, lay naked, with eyes and
mouth wide open to the sun, arms and legs
flung apart, a gash in his stomach, and a
bullet wound with a powder stain between the
eyes. His companions, still wearing their
long cotton shirts and resting on their arms,
might have been feigning sleep; so, as a
matter of precaution we walked round them
at a distance. It came to me that this was
fool business to have started after the general
and I said so. &#8216;Human nature,&#8217; replied
the Scot; &#8216;we have been trying to avoid
the general all morning, now we wished we
had him.&#8217; We talked of going back but
came to the conclusion that it was as far back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
as it was forward, and went on to a knoll,
where four guns had taken up a position and
were blazing away as fast as their gunners
could load them.</p>

<p>Of course our independence of General
Drude revived as we got to a place of more
or less security, and we swung away from
him towards the right flank. Choosing a
good point from which to watch the engagement,
we saluted the captain of a line of
Algerians and lay down among the men.
Below us, in plain view, not a quarter of a
mile away, was the camp of the Moors, about
four hundred tents, ragged and black with
dirt, some of them old circular army tents,
but mostly patched coverings of sacking such
as are to be seen all over Morocco. It was
to destroy this camp, discovered by the
balloon, that the French army had come out,
and we had managed to come over the knoll
at the moment that the first flames were
applied to it. Just beyond the camp the
squalid village of Taddert, beneath a cluster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
of holy tombs, a place of pilgrimage, was
already afire.</p>

<p>The Moors at Taddert had evidently been
taken by surprise. They left most of their
possessions behind in the camp, getting
away with only their horses and their guns.
A soldier of the Foreign Legion came back
driving three undersized donkeys, and carrying
several short, pot-like Moorish drums.
We spoke to him and he told us that they
had taken seven prisoners and had shot them.</p>

<p>The Arabs hung about the hills, keeping
constantly on the move to avoid shells.
Organisation among them seemed totally
lacking and ammunition was evidently scarce.
Once in a while a horseman or a group of two
or three would come furiously charging down
to within a mile of the guns and, turning to
retire again, would send a wild shot or two
in our direction. Wherever a group of more
than three appeared, a shell burst over their
heads and scattered their frightened horses,
sometimes riderless. The fight was entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
one-sided, yet the French general seemed
unwilling to risk a close engagement that
might cost the lives of many of his men.</p>

<p>After an hour my companion, though
under fire for the first time, became, as he
put it, &#8216;exceedingly bored,&#8217; and lying down
on the ground as if for a nap, asked me to
wake him &#8216;if the Moors should come within
photographing distance.&#8217; I suggested that
he might have a look at them with a pair of
glasses and that he might borrow those of
a young officer who had just come up.</p>

<p>&#8216;Monsoor,&#8217; he said, rising and saluting
the officer, &#8216;<i>Permettez moi &agrave; user votre
binoculaires, s&#8217;il vous pla&icirc;t?</i>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You want to look through my glasses?&mdash;certainly,&#8217;
came the reply. &#8216;There, you see
that shot; it is meant for those Moroccans
converging on the sky-line. There, it explodes.
It got four of them. It was well
aimed. These are splendid guns we have.
No other country has such guns. I should
say many of the Moors are killed to-day.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Not less than three hundred. What is that?
Give me my things! Pardon, it is only
<i>les Goumiers</i>. They look like Moroccans
but of course we must not shoot them!&#8217;</p>

<p>The energetic Scot interrupted. &#8216;I
should like to see your men fire a volley
so that I might get a picture; my paper
wants scenes of the fighting about Casablanca.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Perhaps I can do so in a few minutes,
if you stay by me.&#8217;</p>

<p>The general passed within a few yards,
and, ignoring us, went back to the ambulance
brigade to see a wounded man of the Foreign
Legion. We followed him and took his
photograph as he shook hands with the
trooper on the litter.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good picture,&#8217; I said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Rotten,&#8217; said the Scot. &#8216;They&#8217;ll think
in London that I got Drude to pose; the
wounded chap hadn&#8217;t a bloodstain on him
and he smoked a cigarette.&#8217;</p>

<p>We had not long to wait, however, before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
an example of real misery came to our view.
A Goumier covered with blood, riding a
staggering wounded horse, brought in a
Moor without a stitch of clothes, tied by a
red sash to his saddle. Captor, captive, and
horse fell to the ground almost together.
The Goumier had been shot in the chest,
and expired while his fellow horsemen relieved
him of his purple cloak and his turban
and gave him water. The Moor (who had
been taken in the fire at Taddert) was a
mass of burns from head to foot. On one
hand nothing remained but stumps of fingers,
and loose charred flesh hung down from his
legs. Well might the French have shot this
creature; but they bound up his wounds.</p>

<p>At one o&#8217;clock the Arab camp was a mass
of smouldering rags, while Taddert blazed
from every corner. The day&#8217;s work was
done. Long parallel lines of men marching
single file in open order trailed over the
stony ground back towards the white walled
city.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>NO QUARTER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the next excursion with the French I
happened to see the shooting of six prisoners.
We set out from camp as usual at early
morning and moved up the coast for a distance
of eight miles, with the object of
examining a well which in former dry seasons
supplied Casablanca with water and was
now no doubt supplying the Arabs round
about. By marching in close formation and
keeping always down in the slopes between
hills we managed to get to the well and to
swing a troop of Goumiers round it without
being noticed by a party of thirteen Moors,
of whom only three were properly mounted.</p>

<p>The unlucky thirteen had no earthly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
chance. The Goumiers swept down upon
them, killing seven, and taking prisoners the
remaining six. As I was marching with the
artillery at the time, I missed this little
engagement, and my first knowledge of it
was when the prisoners trailed by me on foot:
six tall, gaunt, brown men, bare-legged, and
three of them bare-headed, none clad in more
than a dirty cotton shirt that dragged to his
knees. They moved in quick, frightened
steps, keeping close to one another and
obeying their captors implicitly. Allah had
deserted them and their souls were as water.
The Goumiers, fellow Mohammedans and
devout&mdash;I have seen them pray&mdash;followed
on tight-reined ponies, riding erect in high
desert saddles, their coloured kaftans thrown
back from their sword-arms&mdash;brown men
these too, with small black eyes and huge
noses. French soldiers of the Foreign Legion
drove three undersized asses, carrying immense
pack-saddles of straw and sacking
meant to pad their skinny backs and to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
a rider&#8217;s feet from trailing ground. They
were too small to be worth halter or bridle,
and the soldiers prodded them on with short,
pointed sticks, that brought to my mind
Stevenson&#8217;s &#8216;Travels with a Donkey.&#8217; One
of the Frenchmen brought along a gun, a
long-barrelled Arab flintlock, an antiquated
thing safer to face than to fire. Besides this,
I was told, one of the prisoners had carried
a bayonet fastened with a hemp string to the
end of a stick; the others seem to have been
unarmed. They were indeed a poor bag.</p>

<p>Without the least idea that such prisoners
would be shot, I did not follow to their summary
trial, but moved, instead, over to a
spring, where some artillerists were watering
their horses, while a dozen sporting tortoises
stirred the mud. The gunners had bread
and water, while I had none. Bread and
water are heavy on campaign, and a few
cigarettes I had found were good barter. My
cigarettes were distributed and we were just
beginning our breakfast, when a man standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
up called our attention to the Goumiers
coming our way again with the Moors. They
were walking in the same order, the prisoners
first in a close group, moving quickly on foot,
not venturing to look back, the Goumiers,
probably twenty, riding steady on hard bits.</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Pour les tuer</i>,&#8217; said a soldier, smiling;
&#8216;<i>Pour les tuer</i>,&#8217; repeated the others, looking
at me to see if I smiled.</p>

<p>I shook my head in pity, for the doomed
men were ignorant, pitiable creatures.</p>

<p>A hundred yards beyond us were a clump
of dwarfed trees and some patches of dry
grass, like an oasis among the rolling, almost
barren, hills; and for this spot the Moors
were headed. Mechanically I went on eating,
undecided whether to follow, for I did
not want to see the thing at close range. I
thought the Moors would be lined up in the
usual fashion, their sentence delivered, and a
moment given them for prayer. But suddenly,
while their backs were turned, just as
they set foot upon the dry grass, quickly a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
dozen shots rang out almost in a volley, then
came a straggling fire of single shots. The
single shots were from a pistol, as an officer
passed among the dying men and put a bullet
into the brain of each.</p>

<p>A young Englishman, the Reuter correspondent,
rode over to me from the other
side and asked what I thought. It seemed
to me, I said, rather brutal that they were
not told they were to die.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; said the Englishman. &#8216;I
should say that was considerate. But the
thing isn&#8217;t nice; it isn&#8217;t necessary.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Goumiers set fire to the grass about
the bodies, and soon the smoke and smell,
brought over on a light Atlantic breeze,
caused us to move away.</p>

<p>Across the dusty, shimmering plains
signal fires began to send up columns of
smoke, warning the Arabs beyond of our
approach. But we were going no further.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is no censorship of news in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
England, but the English press often
decides what is good for the public to know
and what it should suppress. In my opinion
the above affair, reported to the London
papers by their own correspondents, who
were witnesses, should have been published.
But the papers either did not publish the
despatches, or else, as in the case of the
<i>Times</i> and the <i>Telegraph</i>, which I saw, they
gave the incident only the briefest notice, and
placed it in a more or less obscure position in
the paper. This, on the part of the London
editors, was no doubt in deference to the
British <i>entente</i> with France. The question
arises in my mind, however, whether a paper
purporting to supply the news has any right
to suppress important news that is legitimate.</p>

<p>The shooting of prisoners continued until
I left Morocco; and I am of the opinion that
it goes on still. The French did not hide
the fact; as I have said, any of the officers
would tell you that they took no prisoners in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
arms. The Arabs opposing them, they
pointed out, were murderers who had looted
Casablanca, attempted to slaughter the
European residents, and failing, had turned
upon each other to fight not only for plunder
but for wives. What would have happened
to the European women, the Frenchmen
asked, had the consulates not sustained the
siege? What happens to French soldiers
who are captured? They argued also that
drastic methods brought submission more
quickly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>THE HOLY WAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Shawia tribesmen made their first
attacks upon the French at Casablanca they
were thoroughly confident of their own
prowess and of the protection of Allah.
They had often, before the coming of the
French, called the attention of Europeans to
the fact that salutes of foreign men-of-war
entering port were not nearly so loud as the
replies from their own antiquated guns&mdash;always
charged with a double load of powder
for the sake of making noise. But they have
come to realise now that Christian ships and
Christian armies have bigger guns than
those with which they salute, and the news
that Allah, whatever may be His reason, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
not on the side of the noisy guns has spread
over a good part of Morocco.</p>

<p>The Arabs now seldom try close quarters
with the French, except when surrounded or
when the French force is very small and
they are numerous; and as I have indicated
before, their defence is most ineffective.
One morning on a march towards Mediuna
I sat for an hour with the Algerians, under
the war balloon, watching quietly an absurd
attack of the tribesmen. From the crest of
a hill, behind which they were lodged, they
would ride down furiously to within half a
mile of us, and turning to go back at the
same mad pace, discharge a gun, without
taking aim, at the balloon, their special
irritation. It was all picturesque, but like
the gallant charge of the brave Bulgarian in
&#8216;Arms and the Man,&#8217; entirely ridiculous. If
the Algerians had been firing at the time,
not one of them would have got back over
their hill.</p>

<p class="caption">A COLUMN OF THE FOREIGN LEGION.</p>

<p>The reports in the London papers of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
serious resistance on the part of the Moors
are seldom borne out by facts. Most of the
despatches, passing through excitable Paris,
begin with startling adjectives and end with
&#8216;Six men wounded.&#8217; Here, for instance, are
the first and the last paragraphs of the Paris
despatch describing the first taking of Settat,
which is over forty miles inland and among
the homes of the Shawia tribesmen. It is
headed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<h3>&#8216;<i>A Sixteen-Hour Fight.</i></h3>

<p>&#8216;At eight a.m. yesterday the French
columns opened battle in the Settat Pass.
The enemy offered a stubborn resistance,
but was finally repulsed, after a fight lasting
until midnight. Settat was occupied and
Muley Rechid&#8217;s camp destroyed.</p>

<p>&#8216;There were several casualties on the
French side.... The enemy&#8217;s losses were
very heavy. The fight has produced a great
impression among the tribes.&#8217;</p>
</div>

<p>The Arab losses under the fire of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
French 75-millim&egrave;tre guns and the fusillade
of the Foreign Legion and the Algerians,
many of them sharpshooters, are usually
heavy where the Arabs attempt a serious
resistance. I should say it would average
a loss on the part of the Moors of fifty dead
to one French soldier wounded. Moreover,
when a Moor is badly wounded he dies, for
the Moors know nothing of medicine, and
the only remedies of which they will avail
themselves are bits of paper with prayers
upon them, written by shereefs; these they
swallow or tie about a wound while praying
at the shrine of some departed saint. It has
seemed to me a wanton slaughter of these
ignorant creatures, but if the French did not
mow them down, the fools would say they
could not, and would thank some saint for
their salvation.</p>

<p>The arms of the Arabs are often of the
most ineffective sort, many of them, indeed,
made by hand in Morocco. While I was
with the French army on one occasion we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
found on a dead Moor (and it is no wonder
he was dead) a modern rifle, of which the
barrel had been cut off, evidently with a
cold chisel, to the length of a carbine. The
muzzle, being bent out of shape and twisted,
naturally threw the first charge back into
the face of the Moor who fired it. I have
seen bayonets tied on sticks, and other
equally absurd weapons.</p>

<p>There are in Morocco many Winchester
and other modern rifles, apart from those
with which the Sultan&#8217;s army is equipped.
Gun-running has long been a profitable
occupation amongst unscrupulous Europeans
of the coast towns, the very people for whose
protection the French invasion is inspired.
A man of my own nationality told me that
for years he got for Winchesters that cost
him 3<i>l.</i> as much as 6<i>l.</i> and 8<i>l.</i> The
authorities, suspecting him on one occasion,
put a Jew to ascertain how he got the rifles
in. Suspecting the Jew, the American
informed him confidentially, &#8216;as a friend,&#8217; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
he brought in the guns in barrels of oil. In
a few weeks five barrels of oil and sixteen
boxes of provisions arrived at &mdash;&mdash; in one
steamer. The American went down to the
custom-house, grinned graciously, and asked
for his oil, which the Moors proceeded to
examine.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no,&#8217; said the American.</p>

<p>The Moors insisted.</p>

<p>The American asked them to wait till
the afternoon, which they consented to do;
and after a superficial examination of one of
the provision boxes, a load of forty rifles, the
butts and barrels in separate boxes, covered
with cans of sardines, tea, sugar, etc., went
up to the store of the American.</p>

<p>It was more profitable to run in guns
that would bring 8<i>l.</i>, perhaps more, than
to run in 8<i>l.</i> worth of cartridges, and
after the Moors had secured modern rifles
they found great difficulty in obtaining
ammunition, which for its scarcity became
very dear. For that reason many of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
have given up the European gun and have
gone back to the old flintlock, made in
Morocco, cheaper and more easily provided
with powder and ball.</p>

<p>Ammunition is too expensive for the
poverty-stricken Moor to waste much of it
on target practice, and when he does indulge
in this vain amusement it is always before
spectators, servants and men too poor to
possess guns; and in order to make an
impression on the underlings&mdash;for a Moor is
vain&mdash;he places the target close enough to
hit. The Moor seldom shoots at a target
more than twenty yards off.</p>

<p>Even the Sultan is economical with ammunition.
It is never supplied to the Imperial
Army&mdash;for the reason that soldiers would
sell it&mdash;except just prior to a fight. It is
told in Morocco that when Kaid Maclean
began to organise the army of Abdul Aziz
he was informed that he might dress the
soldiers as he pleased&mdash;up to his time
they were a rabble crew without uniforms&mdash;but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
that he need not teach them to shoot.
Nor have they since been taught to
shoot.</p>

<p>I am of opinion that the French army
under General d&#8217;Amade, soon to number
12,000 or 13,000 men, could penetrate to
any corner of Morocco with facility, maintaining
at the same time unassailable communication
with their base. A body of the
Foreign Legion three hundred strong could
cut their way across Morocco. With 60,000
men the French can occupy, hold, and effectively
police&mdash;as policing goes in North
Africa&mdash;the entire petty empire. Such an
army in time could make the roads safe for
Arabs and Berbers as well as for Europeans,
punishing severely, as the French have learned
to do, any tribe that dares continue its
marauding practices and any brigand who
essays to capture Europeans; and as for the
rest, the safety of life and property within
the towns and among members of the
same tribes, the instinct of self-preservation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
among the Moors themselves is sufficient.
There is no danger for the French in
Morocco.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, their task is not an easy
one. Conservatism at home and fear of some
foreign protest has kept them from penetrating
the country, as they must, in order to
subdue it. So far they have made their
power felt but locally, and though they have
slain wantonly thousands of Moors, their position
to-day is to all practical purposes the same
as it was after the first engagements about
Casablanca. For four months General Drude
held Casablanca, with tribes defeated but
unconquered all about him. With the new
year General Drude retired and General
d&#8217;Amade took his place, and the district
of operations was extended inland for a
distance of fifty miles. But beyond that
there are again many untaught tribes ranging
over a vast territory.</p>

<p>If the French, from fear of Germany, do
not intend to occupy all Morocco I can see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
for them no alternative but to recognise
Mulai el Hafid, who as Sultan of the interior
is inspiring the tribesmen to war. Hafid&#8217;s
position, though criminal from our point of
view, is undeniably strong.</p>

<p>On proclaiming himself sultan, he sought
to win the support of the country by promising
a Government like that of former
sultans, one that cut off heads, quelled
rebellions, and kept the tribes united and
effective against the Christians. This was
the message that his criers spread throughout
the land; and the people, told that the
French had come as conquerors, gave their
allegiance to him who promised to save
them. Hafid&#8217;s attitude towards the European
Powers was by no means so defiant as
he professed to his people. Emissaries were
sent from Marakesh to London and Berlin to
plead for recognition, but were received
officially at neither capital. He then tried
threats, and at last, in January, declared the
<i>Jehad</i>, or Holy War. But that he really contemplated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
provoking a serious anti-Christian,
or even anti-French, uprising could hardly
be conceived of so intelligent a man; and
hard after the news of this came an assuring
message&mdash;unsolicited, of course&mdash;to the
Legations at Tangier that his object was
only to unite the people in his cause against
his brother. Later, when one of his <i>m&#8217;hallas</i>
took part in a battle against the French he
sent apologies to them.</p>

<p>The Moors, the country over, have heard
of the disasters to the Shawia tribes, at
any rate, of the fighting. Knowing the
hopelessness of combating the French successfully,
the towns of the coast are willing to
leave their future in the diplomatic hands of
Abdul Aziz, in spite of their distaste for him
and his submission to the Christians. Those
of the interior, however, many of whom have
never seen a European, have a horror of the
French such as we should have of Turks, and
they will probably fight an invasion with all
their feeble force.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Because of the harsh yet feeble policy
of the French, the trouble in Morocco, picturesque
and having many comic opera elements,
will drag on its bloody course yet
many months.</p>

<small>FORCED MARCHES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> French Army is an interesting institution
at this moment, when it is known that
the Navy of France ranks only as that of a
second-class Power and it is thought her
military organisation is little better. I am
not in a position to make comparisons,
knowing little of the great armies of
Europe, nor is the detachment of troops in
Morocco, numbering at this writing hardly
8,000 men, a sufficient proportion of the
army of France to allow one to form much
of an opinion. But some observations that
were of interest to me may also interest
others.</p>

<p>The French forces in Morocco represent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the best that the colonies of France produce
in the way of fighting men. European as
well as African troops are from the stations
of Algeria, a colony near enough to France
to partake of her civilisation yet sufficiently
far away to escape conservatism and the
so-called modern movements with which the
home country is afflicted. If there are
weaklings, socialists, and anarchists among
the troops they are in the Foreign Legion,
absorbed and suppressed by the &#8216;gentlemen
rankers.&#8217; The Army is made up of many
elements. Besides ordinary Algerians, it
includes Arabs from the Sahara and negroes
who came originally perhaps as slaves from
the Soudan; besides Frenchmen, there are
in the famous Foreign Legion&mdash;that corps
that asks no questions&mdash;Germans, Bulgarians,
Italians, Russians, and even a few Englishmen.
The main body of the Army is
composed of Algerians proper, Mohammedans,
who speak, or at least understand,
French. They are officered by Frenchmen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
who wear the same uniforms as their men:
the red fezzes and the baggy white bloomers
in the case of infantry, the red Zouave
uniform and boots in the cavalry. These
Algerians, of course, are regular soldiers,
subjected to ordinary military discipline, but
there are too the <i>Goumiers</i>, or <i>Goums</i>, of the
desert, employed in irregular corps for scout
duty and as cavalry, and they, I understand,
are exempt from camp regulations and restrictions
except such as are imposed by
their own leaders. And in the last month
similar troops have been organised from the
tribesmen of the conquered Shawia districts
near to Casablanca.</p>

<p>Algerians and Goumiers, Europeans and
Africans, camp all together in the same
ground, their respective cantonments separated
only by company &#8216;streets.&#8217; The
various commands march side by side and
co-operate as if they were all of one
nationality, a thing which to me, as an
American, knowing that such conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
could not obtain in an American army,
speaks wonders for the French democracy.</p>

<p>A good deal of small gambling goes on
in the French camps, or rather just outside
them; but this seems to be the army&#8217;s only
considerable vice. Drunkenness and disorder
seem to be exceedingly rare. I cannot
imagine a more abstemious body of men.
Of course conditions in the campaign in
which the French are now engaged are all
favourable to discipline; there is the stimulus
of an active enemy, and yet the men are
never overworked, except on occasional long
marches, when they are inspired and encouraged
to test their endurance.</p>

<p>The marching power of the French
infantryman is extraordinary. Carrying two
days&#8217; rations and a portion of a &#8216;dog tent&#8217;
(which fits to a companion&#8217;s portion), he will
&#8216;slog&#8217; nearly fifty miles in a day and a night.
I remember one tremendous march. The
army left camp one morning at three o&#8217;clock,
cavalry, artillery, a hospital staff, <i>Tirailleurs</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
and <i>L&eacute;gionnaires</i>, about 3,000 men, and
marched out fifteen miles to a <i>m&#8217;halla</i>, or
Moorish camp, beyond Mediuna. For more
than two hours they fought the Arabs, finally
destroying the camp; and then returned,
reaching Casablanca shortly before five
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. I did not accompany
the army on this occasion, but went out
to meet it coming back, curious to see how
the men would appear. The Algerians
showed distress the least, hardly a dozen of
them taking the assistance of their comrades,
and many, though covered with dust, so
little affected by fatigue that they could jest
with me about my fresh appearance. When
their officers, about a mile out, gave orders
to halt, then to form in fours to march into
camp in order, they were equal to the part.
But the Foreign Legion obeyed only the
first command, that to halt, and it was a
significant look they returned for the command
of the youthful officer who passed
down the line on a strong horse.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>A still longer march was made by a larger
force of this same army in January, after
General d&#8217;Amade had taken command.
Pushing into the interior from Casablanca to
Settat, they covered forty-eight miles in
twenty-five hours, marching almost entirely
through rough country without roads, or at
best by roads that were little more than
camel tracks. Proceeding at three miles an
hour, the infantry must have done sixteen
hours&#8217; actual walking. Moreover, on arriving
at Settat the army immediately engaged the
<i>m&#8217;halla</i> of Mulai Rachid. Good marching
is a prized tradition with the French, and in
this one thing, if in nothing else, the army of
France excels.</p>

<p>It has been stated by men who have some
knowledge of Moslems, that the French in
Morocco are liable to start that long-threatened
avalanche, the general rising of
Pan-Islam. The first Mohammedans to join
the Moors in the Holy War, it is said, will
be the Algerians. But my own knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
of Moslem countries leads me to argue
otherwise. Since the French have been
in Morocco, now more than six months,
there have been less than a hundred desertions
from the ranks of the Algerians; while
a significant fact on the other side is the
enlistment in the French ranks, in the manner
of Goumiers, of Shawia tribesmen who have
been defeated by them.</p>

<p>It has been from the Foreign Legion
that desertions are frequent. Taking their
leave overnight, the deserters, generally
three or four together, make their way
straight into the Arab country, usually to the
north, with a view to reaching Rabat. In
almost every case the deserters are Germans,
and the Moors permit them to pass, for
they understand that German <i>Nasrani</i> and
French <i>Nasrani</i> hate each other as cordially
as do Arab Moslems and Berber Moslems.
Nevertheless, even though the deserters are
Germans, it is asking too much of the Moor
to spare them their packs as well as their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
lives. I have seen one man come into Rabat
dressed only in a shirt, another, followed by
many Arab boys, wearing a loin-cloth and a
helmet.</p>

<p>The French consul at Rabat makes no
effort to apprehend these men; but they are
usually taken into custody by the German
consul and sent back to their own country in
German ships, to serve unexpired terms in
the army they deserted in the first place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>TANGIER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> see Morocco from another side&mdash;for we
had looked upon the country so far only
from behind French guns&mdash;we started up
the coast on a little &#8216;Scorpion&#8217; steamer, billed
to stop at Rabat. But this unfriendly city is
not to be approached every day in the year,
even by so small a craft as ours, with its
captain from Gibraltar knowing all the
Moorish ports. A heavy sea, threatening to
roll on against the shores for many days,
decided the skipper to postpone his stop and
to push on north to Tangier; and we, though
sleeping on the open deck, agreed to the
change of destination, for we had seen all too
little of &#8216;the Eye of Morocco.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>Tangier is a city outside, so to speak, of
this medi&aelig;val country. It seems like a show
place left for the tourist, always persistent
though satisfied with a glimpse. Men from
within the country come out to this fair to
trade, and others, while following still their
ancient dress and customs, are content to
reside here; yet it is no longer, they will tell
you, truly Morocco. There is no <i>mella</i>
where the Jews must keep themselves;
Spaniards and outcasts from other Mediterranean
countries have come to stay here
permanently and may quarter where they
please, and there is a great hotel by the
water, with little houses in front where
Christians, men and women, go to take off
their strange headgear and some of their
clothes, then to rush into the waves. Truly
Tangier is defiled. Franciscan monks clang
noisy bells, drowning the voice of the <i>muezzin</i>
on the Grand Mosque; the hated telegraph
runs into the city from under the sea; an
infidel&mdash;a Frenchman, of them all&mdash;sits the
day long in the custom-house and takes one-half
the money; and no true Moslem may say
anything to all of this.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ON THE CITADEL. TANGIER.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Still there are compensations. The
Christian may build big ships and guns that
shoot straighter than do Moslem guns, but
he is not so wise. He works all day like
an animal, and when he gets much money
he comes to Tangier with it, and true
believers, who live in cool gardens and
smoke <i>hasheesh</i>, make him pay five times
for everything he buys. He is mad, the
Nazarene.</p>

<p>Seated at a modern French or Spanish
table at a caf&eacute; on the Soko Chico, the
Christian is beset by youthful bootblacks
and donkey drivers; and older Moors in
better dress come up to tell in whispers of
the charms of a Moorish dance&mdash;&#8216;genuine
Moroccan, a Moorish lady, a beautiful
Moorish lady&#8217;&mdash;that can be seen at a quiet
place for ten pesetas Spanish. One of
them, confident of catching us, presents a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
testimonial; and with difficulty we reserve
our smile at its contents:</p>

<p>&#8216;Mohammed Ben Tarah, worthy descendant
of the Prophet, is a first-class guide
to shops which pay him a commission on
what you buy. He will take you also to
see a Moorish dance, thoroughly indecent,
well imitated, for all I know, by a fat Jewish
woman. He has an exaggerated idea of
his superficial knowledge of the English
language, and as a prevaricator of the truth
he worthily upholds the reputation of his
race.&#8217; (Signed.)</p>

<p>The Soko Chico of Tangier, though an
unwholesome place, is thoroughly interesting.
About the width of the Strand and half the
length of Downing Street&mdash;that is, in American,
half a block long-it is large enough, as
spaces go in Morocco, to be called a market
and to be used as such. From early morn
until midnight the &#8216;Little Sok&#8217; is crowded
with petty merchants, whose stock of edibles,
brought on platters or in little handcarts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
could be bought for a Spanish dollar. Mightily
they shout their wares, five hundred &#8216;hawkers&#8217;
in a space of half as many feet. The noise
is terrific. The cry of horsemen for passage,
the brawl of endless arguments, the clatter of
small coins in the hands of money-changers,
and the strains of the band at the &#8216;Grand
Caf&eacute;,&#8217; struggling to make audible selections
from an opera; all these together create an
infernal din. The Soko Chico, where the
post-offices of the Powers alternate with
European caf&eacute;s, is, of all Morocco, the place
where East and West come into closest touch.
The Arab woman, veiled, sits cross-legged in
the centre of the road, selling to Moslems
bread of semolina, and the foreign consul,
seated at a caf&eacute; table, sips his glass of absinthe.
Occasionally a horseman with long, bushed
hair, goes by towards the <i>kasbah</i>, followed a
moment later by the English colonel, who
lives on the <i>Marshan</i> and wears a helmet.
A score of tourists gather at the caf&eacute; tables
in the afternoon, and as many couriers, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
brown, knotty, big-veined legs, always bare,
squat against the walls of the various foreign
post-offices, resting till the last moment before
beginning their long, perilous, all-night runs.
Jews who dress in gaberdines listen to Jews
in European clothes, telling them about
America.</p>

<p>But there is another Sok, the Outer Sok,
beyond the walls, where the camels and the
story-tellers come, and this is no hybrid
place, but &#8216;real Morocco,&#8217; and as fine a Sok
as any town but Fez or Marakesh can show.
Here, across a great open space that rises
gradually from the outer walls, are stretched
rows upon rows of ragged tents as high as
one&#8217;s shoulder, and before them sit their
keepers: Arab barbers ready to shave a head
from ear to ear or leave a tuft of hair; unveiled
Berber women, generally tattooed,
selling grapes and prickly pears, or as they
call them, Christian figs; Soudanese, sometimes
freemen, trading or holding ponies for
hire; women from the Soudan, generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
pock-marked and mostly slaves, squatting
among their masters&#8217; vegetables; Riff men
who have come perhaps from forty miles
away to sell a load of charcoal worth two
francs; pretty little half-veiled girls, with one
earring, selling bread broken into half and
quarter loaves; soldiers feeling the weight of
each small piece and asking for half a dozen
seeds of pomegranate as an extra inducement
to buy; minstrels and snake-charmers and
bards; water-carriers tinkling bells; blind
beggars with their doleful chants&mdash;&#8216;Allah,
Allah-la&#8217;; camel-drivers; saints. At dark
the big Sok goes to bed with the camels and
the donkeys and the sheep; man and beast
bed down together; and it is an eerie place to
pick one&#8217;s way through when the night is
dark. From choice we lived, when in
Tangier, across the big Sok, at the H&ocirc;tel
Cavilla, and sometimes of an evening, after
dinner, would descend the slope, passing
through the gates, down the narrow, cobbled
streets, to the Soko Chico, with its flaring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
caf&eacute;s, to sit perhaps and watch a Moorish
kaid pit his skill at chess against a German
champion. It was the business of Kaid
Driss, commander of artillery, to be in readiness
at this central square to go to any gate
which Raisuli or another hostile leader might
suddenly attack; and so this splendid Moor,
a well-liked gentleman, spent the weary hours
until midnight at this, the Moors&#8217; favourite
game. Around the corners, under dank
arches, slept his troops, covered even to their
noses, their guns, too, underneath their white
jelebas. Except the Kaid himself there
seemed to be no other Moorish soldier
stirring after nine, or at the latest, ten o&#8217;clock,
and if we should delay our stay within the
walls beyond this hour, nothing but a Spanish
or other coin more valuable than a Moorish
piece would quiet the complaining brave
who pulled himself together to unbar the
gates for us to pass.</p>

<p>It is not only, however, when the sun is
down that the Moor sleeps; he sleeps by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
day, as he tells you his religion teaches,
and rolled in woollen cloth lies anywhere
that slumber overtakes him, in the sands
upon the beach, on the roadway under
gates&mdash;what difference does it make, the
earth is sweet and a hard bed is best! Why
work like the Christian to spend like a fool?</p>

<p>One day I saw a fisherman without
a turban, sitting on a rock, beside him a
sleeping bundle of homespun <i>haik</i>. They
were a pretty pair, and with my kodak I proceeded
out to where they were, going
cautiously, intending to get a picture, from
behind, of the shaved head and its single
trailing scalp-lock. But the fisherman discovered
me and hurriedly lifted the hood of
his jeleba, muttering something. The sound
waked the sleeping bundle, which moved
itself a moment, then poked out a likewise
shaven head and a youthful face thinly
covered with sprouting beard. &#8216;You English
man?&#8217; said the head.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, &#8217;Merican,&#8217; I replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8216;Dat&#8217;s better; more richer. Open you
mouth and show dis chap you got gold
teeth.&#8217;</p>

<p>I did as he bade and disappointed him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Me woman,&#8217; he continued.</p>

<p>&#8216;A bearded woman,&#8217; I suggested; at
which he laughed and explained (still lying
on his back) that he had been to Earl&#8217;s Court
once, in a show, that he had had no beard
then, being but sixteen, and because he wore
what seemed to Londoners to be a feminine
attire they all thought he was a woman.</p>

<p>The Arab quarter of Tangier is entirely
Moorish. The <i>kasbah</i> or citadel, high above
the water of the Straits, has its own walls, as
is customary, and within these, though the
architecture may not be so fine as that at
Fez, there is yet no Christian and no
Christian way; it is thoroughly Moorish.
The tourist may enter without a guide and
poke his way through the heavy arches and
the stair-like streets. He may go into the
square where the Basha governing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
district, like the Sultan at the capital, receives
delegations and hears the messages of tribesmen
in trouble; but the infidel, even though
he be a foreign minister, may not enter
mosque or fort or arsenal, or any other place
except the residence of the kaid who is
in command.</p>

<p>He may look in, however, at the door of
the prison and even talk to victims crowded
within, but there is much grumbling and no
doubt some cursing if he goes away forgetting
to distribute francs among the dozen
jailers whose &#8216;graft&#8217;&mdash;to use an expressive
American term&mdash;is to make a living in this
way from Europeans. There is one man in
prison here who speaks a little English and
tells you that he has been in jail for more
than ten long years and will be there for
ever, for he has no money and his friends
are far up country. He was imprisoned, so
he says, because a rival told the Basha that
he had smuggled arms from Spain. Now
smuggling arms is a trade that meets, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
ports where consuls do not interfere, with
speedy execution. Not many years ago this
punishment was meted out to some offenders
even in Tangier. There is a graphic story
of one such killing told in a book by an
Italian, De Amicis, published many years
ago:</p>

<p>&#8216;An Englishman, Mr. Drummond Hay,
coming out one morning at one of the gates
of Tangier, saw a company of soldiers dragging
along two prisoners with their arms
bound to their sides. One was a mountain
man from the Riff, formerly a gardener to
a European resident at Tangier; the other,
a young fellow, tall, and with an open and
attractive countenance. The Englishman
asked the officer in command what crime
these two unfortunate men had committed.</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8220;The Sultan,&#8221; was the answer&mdash;&#8220;may
God prolong his life!&mdash;has ordered their heads
to be cut off, because they have been engaged
in contraband trade on the coast of the Riff
with infidel Spaniards.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8216;&#8220;It is very severe punishment for such a
fault,&#8221; observed the Englishman; &#8220;and if it is
to serve as a warning and example to the
inhabitants of Tangier, why are they not
allowed to witness the execution?&#8221; (The
gates of the city had been closed, and
Mr. Drummond Hay had caused one to be
opened for him by giving money to the
guard.)</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8220;Do not argue with me, Nazarene,&#8221; responded
the officer; &#8220;I have received an
order and must obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8216;The decapitation was to take place in the
Hebrew slaughterhouse. A Moor of vulgar
and hideous aspect was there awaiting the
condemned. He had in his hand a small
knife about six inches long. He was a
stranger in the city, and had offered himself
as executioner because the Mohammedan
butchers of Tangier, who usually fill that
office, had all taken refuge in a mosque.</p>

<p>&#8216;An altercation now broke out between
the soldiers and the executioner about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
reward promised for the decapitation of the
two poor creatures, who stood by and listened
to the dispute over the blood-money. The
executioner insisted, declaring that he had
been promised twenty francs a head, and
must have forty for the two. The officer at
last agreed, but with a very ill grace. Then
the butcher seized one of the condemned
men, already half dead with terror, threw him
on the ground, kneeled on his chest, and put
the knife into his throat. The Englishman
turned away his face. He heard the sounds
of the violent struggle. The executioner
cried out: &#8220;Give me another knife; mine
does not cut!&#8221; Another knife was brought,
and the head separated from the body. The
soldiers cried in a faint voice: &#8220;God prolong
the life of our lord and master!&#8221; but many of
them were stupefied.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then came the other victim, the handsome
and amiable-looking young man. Again
they wrangled over his blood. The officer,
denying his promise, declared that he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
give but twenty francs for both heads. The
butcher was forced to yield. The condemned
man asked that his hands might be unbound.
Being loosed, he took his cloak and gave it
to the soldier who had unbound him, saying:
&#8220;Accept this; we shall meet in a better
world.&#8221; He threw his turban to another,
who had been looking at him with compassion;
and stepping to the place where lay
the bloody corpse of his companion, he said
in a clear, firm voice: &#8220;There is no God
but God, and Mohammed is His prophet!&#8221;
Then, taking off his belt, he gave it to the
executioner, saying: &#8220;Take it; but for the
love of God cut my head off more quickly
than you did my brother&#8217;s.&#8221; He stretched
himself upon the earth, in the blood, and the
executioner kneeled upon his chest....</p>

<p>&#8216;A few minutes after, two bleeding
heads were held up by the soldiers. Then
the gates of the city were opened and there
came forth a crowd of boys who pursued the
executioner with stones for three miles, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
he fell fainting to the ground covered with
wounds. The next day it was known that
he had been shot by a relation of one of
the victims.... The authorities of Tangier
apparently did not trouble themselves about
the matter, since the assassin came back into
the city and remained unmolested. After
having been exposed three days the heads
were sent to the Sultan, in order that his
Imperial Majesty might recognise the promptitude
with which his orders had been
fulfilled.&#8217;</p>

<p>Since this incident of thirty years ago
Tangier has changed. No longer may a
man be flogged in public in the Sok; no
longer may the slave be sold at auction; no
longer may the heads of the Sultan&#8217;s enemies
hang upon the gates; for the place is
dominated now by foreign ministers. Though
still in name within the empire of the Sultan,
it is defiled for ever, gone over to the
Christian.</p>

<small>RAISULI PROTECTED BY GREAT BRITAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> years ago Tangier and the surrounding
districts were governed by one Mulai Hamid
ben Raisul, better known as Raisuli, a
villainous blackguard who was finally deposed
through the interference of the foreign legations.
To-day this same Raisuli enjoys the
interest on &pound;15,000 (&pound;5,000 having been
given him in cash) and the protection ordinarily
accorded to a British subject; and
these favours are his because he deprived of
liberty for seven months Kaid Sir Harry
Maclean, a British subject in the employ of
the Sultan Abdul Aziz. According to the
terms of the ransom, which permit Raisuli, if
he conducts himself in honourable fashion, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
receive the sum invested for him at the end
of three years, it is probable that the world
will hear no more of him in his popular r&ocirc;le;
and, therefore, it might be interesting&mdash;also
because of the light the story will throw on
the ways of the Moorish Government and of
diplomacy at Tangier&mdash;to sum up the exploits
of this notorious brigand.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_096.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A RIFF TRIBESMAN. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A MAGHZEN SOLDIER.</p>



<p>Raisuli, as his title <i>Mulai</i> implies, is a
Shereef or descendant of the Prophet, and
partly for that distinction, aside from personal
power, he holds a certain influence over the
K&#8217;mass and other tribes about Tangier.
Being a shrewder villain than the others of
his race who aspire to govern districts, he
adopted early in his career other methods
than that which is the custom&mdash;of purchasing
positions from the Maghzen. The system
of buying a governorship, to hold it only till
some other Moor bought it over the head of
the first and sent him to prison, did not
appeal to Raisuli. The mountains of the
Riff were impregnable against the feeble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
forces of the Sultan, and for a rifle and a
little not-too-dangerous fighting all his
tribesfolk could be got to serve him as their
leader. So Raisuli started out for power&mdash;a
thing the Moor loves&mdash;in a manner new to
Morocco.</p>

<p>It was in 1903 that he captured his first
European, the <i>Times</i> correspondent, W. B.
Harris, who, speaking Arabic, negotiated
his own surrender, and within three weeks
left the mountains of the Riff on the release
of a number of Raisuli&#8217;s men from Moorish
prisons. For a year thereafter there prevailed
intense fear in the suburbs, outside
the walls of Tangier, where the better class
of Europeans live. Raisuli had many followers,
and the Maghzen was powerless
against him, while raids about Tangier and
robberies were of almost nightly occurrence.
Yet some of the Europeans, those who felt a
sentimental interest in the independence of
Morocco and wanted to see the good old
Moorish ways survive, seemed ready to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
welcome &#8216;the really strong man who was
coming to the fore.&#8217; It fell to the lot of an
American of Greek descent, a Mr. Perdicaris,
to receive the next pressing invitation to the
interior. Raisuli and a band of followers
entered the Perdicaris home one evening,
and after breaking up many things, packing
off others, and maltreating his wife, they
escorted the American himself to their
mountain fastnesses. As is the usual way of
Western governments in these matters&mdash;I
do not intend to suggest another method&mdash;the
State Department at Washington demanded
from the Sultan the release of the
captive, pressing the demand with the visit
of a warship. The Maghzen, seeing no
other way, met Raisuli&#8217;s terms, again releasing
many tribesmen, and paying the brigand
&pound;11,000, besides establishing him as governor
of Tangier.</p>

<p>Of course in this capacity the &#8216;strong
man&#8217; superseded the European Legations in
control of the town. The old order of things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
began to revive. Moors were beaten on
the market-place; Moslems again insulted
Europeans and jostled them in the streets;
and soon, the Legations feared, heads would
hang again upon the city gates. So an
appeal went up to the Sultan that Raisuli be
displaced, and Abdul Aziz, though he had
evidently pledged himself to Raisuli, readily
agreed to the demands of the European
representatives. But the wary governor,
getting wind of a plot, escaped to the
mountains before the arrival of the Sultan&#8217;s
emissaries; and though troops followed him,
burned and pillaged his home and carried
off his women, the fugitive himself escaped
to renew armed hostilities against the
Maghzen soldiers.</p>

<p>Unable to defeat the brigand at arms,
after many months Abdul Aziz decided to
employ diplomacy, and Kaid Maclean, old
and wise in the ways of the Moors and
trusted by those who knew him, undertook
for the Sultan to convey new pledges to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Raisuli and to guarantee them with the word
of a Britisher. But the brigand wanted
something more substantial, and though he
had given his word of honour&mdash;his <i>&iuml;amen</i>&mdash;that
he would not molest the Kaid, the old
Scotsman was made prisoner when he
arrived; for Kaid Maclean went to meet
Raisuli with only half-a-dozen men, hoping
to inspire him with trust and to win his
confidence.</p>

<p>After demanding, I am told, &pound;120,000
(together with the release from prison of
many tribesmen and the return of his women),
the brigand finally agreed to accept the sum
of &pound;20,000 and the protection of a British
subject. This last, which was proposed by
the British Government, brings Raisuli of
course under the jurisdiction of the Consular
Court, and, to fetch him from the mountains
in case he should be wanted, &pound;15,000 of the
&pound;20,000 ransom is deposited to his credit in
a bank, subject to his good behaviour. But I
am not sure that the British Government did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
an all-wise thing. Foreign protection is
greatly sought after by the Moors. In the
case of others who enjoy it the power is
used to plunder their fellows, and Raisuli
may be expected to employ his strength and
his new position in some cunning way. The
Moorish authorities, always anxious to avoid
encounters with the consulates and legations,
generally allow protected subjects to do what
they please. Raisuli may now exploit his
fellow-countrymen with certain safety, or he
may direct the profitable business of gun-running&mdash;at
which he has already had considerable
experience, like many other <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>
and foreign residents&mdash;and no one is likely
to protest.</p>

<p>At any rate it seems hardly fair to protect
a villain in this manner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>DOWN THE COAST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Luck</span> with me seems to run in spells. Once
on a campaign in the Balkans I had the good
fortune to be on hand at everything; massacre,
assassination, nor dynamite attack
could escape me; I was always on the spot
or just at a safe distance off. In Morocco
things went consistently the other way.
Beginning with the Casablanca affair when
I was in America, everything of a newspaper
value happened while I was somewhere else.
The day the Sultan entered Rabat after his
long march from the interior, I sailed past the
town unable to land. Now I was to be
taken to Laraiche, when a month before I
had failed to get there to meet the two score
European refugees coming down from Fez.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>We took passage&mdash;Weare and I&mdash;on the
same little steamer by which we had come to
Tangier, bound now down the Atlantic coast,
again intending to stop at Rabat, &#8216;weather
permitting.&#8217; There was not a breath of air;
the sea was &#8216;like a painted ocean&#8217;; every
prospect favoured. But our captain, the
Scorpion villain, hugged the coast with a
purpose, and as might have been expected
the ship was signalled at Laraiche. We had
to stop and pick up freight, which proved to
be some forty crates of eggs billed for
England. Old memories of unhappy breakfasts
revived, and, our sympathies going out
to fellow Christians back in London, we
argued with the captain that it was not fair
to take aboard these perishable edibles till
he should return from Mogador. But the
captain smiled, putting a stubby finger to his
twisted nose, and explained that though eggs
were eggs, the wind might be blowing from
the west when the ship passed back. But
though my ill-fortune in Morocco was enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
to ruin the reputation of a Bennet Burleigh,
there were always compensations, and on
this occasion we were recompensed with a
sight of the most fascinating port along the
Moorish coast.</p>

<p>As the ship moves into the river
cautiously, to avoid the bar, you ride beneath
the walls and many domes of a great white
castle, silent, to all appearances deserted, and
overgrown with cactus bushes. Below&mdash;for
the castle stands high upon a rock&mdash;is an
ancient fortress, also white, which the ship
passes so close that it is possible, even in the
twilight, to make out upon the muzzles of the
one-time Spanish guns designs of snakes
and wreaths of flowers; and looking over
the parapet you may see the old-time mortars
made in shapes like squatting gnomes. From
the ship that night we watched the moon
rise and the phosphorescence play upon the
water, and the splendid Oriental castle took
on a fairy-like enchantment.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_104.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE CASTLE AT LARAICHE.</p>

<p>In the morning the little city appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
unlike other Moorish towns; where they are
mostly grey or white, with here and there
a green-tiled mosque, Laraiche affects all
manner of colour. Among the white and
blue houses there may be green or orange,
yellow or brown or red, and likewise the
inhabitants, curiously, go in for gaily coloured
cloaks. On one side of the river this brilliant
city rose from the ancient walls; on the other
a cluster of sand dunes sloped back to the
hills a mile or more away, and behind them,
far in the distance, towered the Red Mountain,
which Raisuli has made famous. Great
lighters, things like Noah&#8217;s arks, rowed by
fifteen, sometimes twenty, turbaned men,
pushed off from the little quay to bring our
cargo, and smaller craft began to cross the
river to ferry over country people and their
animals, along with one or two poor, fagged-out
letter carriers, who had come afoot from
Tangier, forty miles, overnight. By one of
the smaller boats which came alongside we
went ashore, to remain three days awaiting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
further belated shipment of grain that came
by camel train from the interior. We went
to the only hotel, kept of course by a Spaniard,
though designed specially to attract the
British tourists of the Forwood line. The
walls of the tiny, wood-partitioned rooms
(spacious Moorish halls cut to cubicles) are
papered like children&#8217;s playrooms, with
pictures from old <i>Graphics</i> and other London
weeklies, planned no doubt to amuse the
visitor when it rains, for on such occasions
the streets of Laraiche are veritable rapids.
The room which I occupied hung over the
city walls and looked down on the banks of
the river, dry at low tide. Being waked
early one morning by some hideous sounds
and muffled voices, we peered cautiously out
of the window and in the dim light discerned
a crowd of black-gowned Jews not twenty
feet below, killing a cow. This bank at low
tide is the slaughterhouse, where a dead
beast of some kind lay continually. Fortunately
the rising waters carried off the few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
remains that Jews and Moslems left; and
fortunately, too, the place was not used also
as the boneyard, where animals that have
died of natural causes are dragged and
heaped uncovered. Such a spot there is
outside the walls of every Moorish town.</p>

<p>Laraiche is off the great trade routes,
and the district round about is unproductive.
For these reasons its poor inhabitants, unable
to own guns and riding horses, are
peaceable and submissive. The town as
well as the surrounding country is safe for
any Christian, and even insults for him are
few. We went with our ragged old guide,
who bore the fitting name of Sidi Mohammed,
up through the Kasbah, as fine a ruin of
Moorish architecture as I have seen, and out
through a long tunnel to the quaint old
market-place, broad and white, flanked on
each side by long, low rows of colonnades,
the ends, through which the trains of camels
come, sustained by several arches, none the
same, opening in various directions. Certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
the Moors who built this town were
architects and artists too. But the poverty and
the degradation of the place! The houses,
dark and wretched; the tea-shops foul and
small and crowded much like opium dens;
the people lean and miserable and cramped
with hungry stomachs, dirty and diseased.
Though clad in rags of brightest colours, the
average human being is marked over with
pox or something worse, and his head is scaly,
the hair growing only in blotches. Children
follow you, with paper patches, the prayers
of some mad saint, tied about their running,
bloodshot eyes; old men hobble by, one lean
leg covered with sores, the other swollen huge
with elephantiasis, both bare and horrible.
Laraiche is beautiful and awful.</p>

<p>We saw a funeral here, and I thought we
Christians could learn something from these
Moors. In this sad country a man is hardly
dead before they bury him. As soon as the
grave can be dug the corpse is taken on the
shoulders of friends, and quickly, to the music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of a weird chant, borne to the grave. Without
a flood of agony and an aftermath of
long-extended mourning, the body is consigned
to earth, and the soul that has departed,
to the tender mercy of almighty God. An
unmarked sandstone is erected; and if a
relative wore a cloak of green or red before
the parting, green or red is his colour still.</p>

<p>The day we left Laraiche a heavy breeze
blew from the sea, white-capped rollers broke
upon the shore, and we knew that Rabat was
not to be reached. We passed on to Casablanca,
where, the harbour being better, we
were able to land. Now after all these disappointments
we were resolved to get to
Rabat at any cost. If it were necessary, we
would go by land and run the gauntlet of the
Shawia tribes, professing to be Germans
deserting from the Foreign Legion; but the
French consul saved us this. From him we
obtained permission to go back by torpedo-boat
and to be transhipped, so to speak, to
the cruiser <i>Gueydon</i>, where we might stay as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
long as was necessary, as the ship was permanently
anchored off Rabat. In two days
after boarding the <i>Gueydon</i> the Atlantic
calmed, and we left, bidding adieu to our
French hosts, to cross the bar of the Bu
Regreg in a twenty-oared Moorish boat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>AT RABAT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the time that the Krupp Company
were mounting heavy-calibre guns at Rabat
other German contractors proposed to cut
the bar of the Bu Regreg and open the port
to foreign trade. But the people of both
Rabat and Sali protested, saying that this
would let in more <i>Nasrani</i> and that the half-dozen
already there, who bought their rugs
and sold them goods from Manchester and
Hamburg, were quite enough. Up to the
time the French gunboats appeared&mdash;preceded
by the news of their effective work at
Casablanca&mdash;the arrival of twenty Europeans
at Rabat would have given rise to much
murmuring and no doubt to a good many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
threats. Now, however, more than double
that number of Frenchmen alone had come
to the town. From Tangier had come the
Minister of France and all his staff, accompanied
by a score of soldiers and marines;
and from Casablanca had followed a troop of
correspondents, French and English. Yet
the hapless Moors, stirred as they had never
been before, were required to give them
right of way.</p>

<p>&#8216;Balak! Balak!&#8217; went the cry of the
Maghzen soldier, leading the Christians
through the crowded, narrow streets, and
meekly, usually without a protest, the natives
stood aside. Most of the people did not
understand. Had not the Prophet said that
they should hate the Christians? Yet now
their lord, Mulai Abdul Aziz, Slave of the
Beloved, sat upon his terrace&mdash;so rumour
vowed&mdash;sat with some Frenchmen and
listened towards Ziada to the cannon of some
other Frenchmen as they slaughtered faithful
Moslems! At Rabat, besides the townsfolk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
there were refugees from Casablanca; there
were tribesmen still in arms; there were
saints who had followed the Sultan from
Fez; there were madmen who are sacred,
and impostors who pretended to be mad;
there were soldiers trained to every crime;
in short, there were men from every corner
of the variegated empire, any one of
whom would gladly have laid down his life
to slay a Christian had the Sultan so commanded.
Yet months have passed and
they have kept the peace, though Frenchmen
still slay Moors within the sound of
Rabat&#8217;s walls.</p>

<p>A Shawia tribesman who spoke a little
English, a tall young man with dark skin,
and an ear torn by an earring at the lobe,
met us at the landing and extended his hand.
He took upon himself to help us with our
luggage, and we let him show us the way to
the French hotel lately opened. Of course
this man was anxious to serve us as guide
and interpreter, and we were glad to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
him. Driss Wult el Kaid was his name,
Driss, son of the Kaid. He had worked for
Englishmen at Casablanca, and from his
accent we could tell they had been &#8216;gentlemen.&#8217;
No &#8216;h&#8217;s&#8217; did he shift from place to
place, while his pronunciation of such words
as &#8216;here&#8217; and &#8216;there&#8217; were always drawled
out &#8216;hyar&#8217; and &#8216;thar.&#8217; &#8216;Now, now,&#8217; he
would say with a twisting inflection, for all
the world like an Oxford man wishing to
express the ordinary negative &#8216;no.&#8217; It was
humorous. English of this sort, to the mind
of a mere American, associates itself with
aristocracy, while the face of a mulatto goes
only with the under-race of the States. It
was difficult, in consequence, to reconcile the
two. But Driss soon demonstrated that he
was worthy to speak the language of the
upper man. The manners and the dignity
of a ruling race were his heritage; and proud
he was, though his bearing towards the
poorest beggar never appeared condescending.
A gentleman was Driss. &#8216;Me fader,&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
he told us in fantastic Moro-English, &#8216;me
fader he was one-time gov&#8217;nor Ziada.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is he dead?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, now; he in prison.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What for?&#8217; we asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Me fader,&#8217; Driss explained, looking
sorrowful, &#8216;he paid ten thousan&#8217; dollar
Hassani for (to be) gov&#8217;nor; two year more
late &#8217;nother man pay ten thousan&#8217; dollar
more, and he &#8217;come gov&#8217;nor; me fader got
no more money, so go prison.&#8217; This was the
old story, the same wherever Mohammedans
govern; one man buys the right to rule and
rob a province; over his head another buys
it, to be succeeded by a third, and so on.</p>

<p>We told Driss that this could not happen
if the French ruled the country; it could not
happen, we said, in Algeria.</p>

<p>&#8216;I know, I know,&#8217; said Driss. &#8216;Me fader
he write (wrote) in a book about Algeria,
and he teach me to read. Tell me, Mr.
Moore, is it true a man can give his money
to &#8217;nother man and get a piece of paper, then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
go back long time after and get his money
back?&#8217;</p>

<p>I told Driss that there were such institutions
as banks, which even the Sultan could
not rob; and he believed, but seemed to
wonder all the more what manner of men
Christians were. &#8216;It is fiendish; no wonder
they defeat us; they work together inhumanly,&#8217;
he seemed to say; &#8216;indeed you
cannot know our God!&#8217;</p>

<p>Good old Driss; both Weare and I became
very fond of him. In a day he spoke of himself
as our friend, and I believe we could have
trusted him in hard emergencies. He was
brave and not unduly cautious, though occasionally,
when we would stop in a road and
gather a crowd, he would say imperatively:
&#8216;Come away, Mr. Weare and Mr. Moore;
some fanatic may be in that crowd and stick
you with his dagger. Come on, come on!&mdash;I&#8217;m
your friend; I don&#8217;t want see you
dead.&#8217;</p>

<p>Driss had vanities. He told us his age,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
twenty-three, and told us in the same breath
that few Moors knew exactly how old they
were. He said his wife&mdash;who was only
twenty&mdash;could read and write a little, informing
us at the same time that very few women
could read. He told us that his wife was
almost white. Driss was ashamed of his
own colour, and when a French correspondent
asked in his presence if he was a slave,
the poor boy coloured and dropped his head.
He had certainly been born of a slave.</p>

<p>Still there was nothing humble about
Driss. Among his people he was exceptional
and he enjoyed the distinction. He
was a Ziada man; he could read and write;
he could make more money than his fellows&mdash;and
he hoped some day to acquire
European protection; he was fine-looking,
tall, strong, and without disease.</p>

<p>Driss was a thoroughly clean fellow. He
never touched bread without washing his
hands, a custom prevailing among some
Moslems but not general with the Moors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
This with him seemed only a matter of
habit and desire of decency, for he was not
particularly devout in his religion.</p>

<p>&#8216;But you think,&#8217; we said, &#8216;that all <i>Nasrani</i>
are unclean.&#8217; At first Driss denied this, out
of consideration for us, but on being pressed
he admitted that it was the feeling of the
ignorant of his race that, like pigs, all
Christians were filthy in person as well as
soul.</p>

<p>We discussed with him the great moral
vice of Mohammedan countries, and he
admitted that it was prevalent in Morocco
no less than, as we told him, it prevailed
farther east, and that it affected all classes.
He told me that it was the custom of the
wealthy father of the better class of Moors,
in order to protect his sons, to make them
each a present of a slave girl as they attain
the age of fifteen or sixteen. Of course,
from the Mohammedan point of view, there
is nothing immoral in this; indeed the
mothers of sons often advocate it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>It was the fasting month of Ramadan
at the time of our sojourn at Rabat, and
no one could eat except at night. Every
evening at six o&#8217;clock a white-cloaked gunner
came out of the Kasbah walls and rammed
into his antique cannon a load of powder
sufficient, it would seem, to raise the dead
of the cemetery in which it was discharged.
For two reasons&mdash;that it was the
cemetery and that the Ramadan gun was
here&mdash;this was the gathering-place of all
Moslems. Often we, too, went up to see
the crowd and to watch with the gunner
and the other Moors for the signal. All
eyes were turned, not towards the Atlantic
to see old Sol set, but inland, towards the
town, where towered above the low houses
a great white minaret, whence the Muezzin
watched the sun and signalled with a banner
of white. At the blast of the cannon a
great shout went up from the hundred small
boys gathered about; and, with the slope of
the hill to lend them speed, everybody went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
hurrying into the town, the skirts of those
who ran fluttering a yard behind them. In
a minute came the boom from the gun of the
<i>m&#8217;halla</i>, the city of tents, on the hills visible
beyond the town walls. When we passed
down the streets to our supper five minutes
later, everybody was swallowing great gulps
of <i>hererah</i>, Ramadan soup, breaking the
long day&#8217;s fast. The little caf&eacute;s, dingy and
deserted during the day, were now brilliant
and crowded, the keeper himself eating with
one hand while he served with the other;
and the roadway was studded with little
groups of men who had squatted where they
stood half-an-hour before the setting of the
sun, and, spoon in hand, waited for the gun
to boom.</p>

<p>Christians and Mohammedans treat their
religions with a curious difference: where
the one is generally ashamed of reverence
and never flaunts his faith, the other is
afraid not to make a considerable show of
his. Not a Moor would dare to eat or even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
touch a drop of water in the sight of
another during Ramadan; though under our
window overlooking the river it was the
custom of an old beggar to come daily at
noon, to roll himself into a ball on the
ground as if sleeping, and under the cover
of his ragged <i>jeleba</i> make his lunch. Had
he been caught at this he would probably
have been stoned out of town.</p>

<p>One day during Ramadan we were
taken by a Jewish merchant, a British
subject, to the house of a wealthy Moor
with whom he traded in goods from Manchester.
The house was down a turning off
the street of arches, and the turning came to
an end at the Moor&#8217;s door, a massive oaken
door with the heads of huge rivets showing
every six or seven inches. It was the width
of the narrow street, about six feet, and the
height of one&#8217;s shoulder. We approached
quietly and knocked lightly, for our friend
told us that the Moor did not care for his
neighbours to see us entering his house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
The entrance, which was at one corner of
the square house, led into the courtyard, of
which the ornate walls were spotlessly white-washed,
the floor was of green tiles, and
the roof, as is usual, of glass. The reception
room, the length of one side of the
house, though but twelve feet wide, had low
divans all round the walls, leaving but a
long, narrow aisle the length of the room, to
the right and to the left of the arched
entrance. Rising in tiers at each end were
broader divans, to appear as beds one
beyond another, though their luxurious and
expensive upholstering, covered with the
richest of native silks, were evidently never
displaced by use. About the room, in cases
above the divans, were many little ornaments,
noticeably tall silver sprinklers filled
with rose-water and other perfumes; but most
curious to us were the innumerable clocks,
most of them cheap things, all set at different
hours in order that their bells should
not drown each other&#8217;s melodious clangs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Two little slave girls, who giggled at us
all the while, brought in a samovar much
after the Russian pattern, and silver boxes of
broken cone sugar and of European biscuits.
Our host made tea in the native fashion,
brewed with quantities of sugar and flavoured
heavily with mint; green tea, of course. He
filled our cups again and again, though he
would take nothing, till we too wished we
respected Ramadan, for we were told by our
Jewish friend that it would be impolite to
drink less than five or six cups. Along with
this refreshment the silver sprinklers were
passed us by the giggling little blacks, that
we might sprinkle our clothes, and no doubt
they thought we needed perfuming, though
they did not hold their noses, as other Europeans
have told me they often do when close
to Nazarenes. Perhaps their master had
instructed them in good behaviour, for he
was indeed a gentleman, and he had travelled
on one occasion to London and to Paris.
It was at this point, when the Moor, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
immaculate fingers, sprinkled his own long
white robes, that one could appreciate their
feeling that we are filthy people. We wear
the same outer garments for months, and
they are never washed; indeed, we wear
dark colours that the dirt may not show;
here we had entered upon this gentleman&#8217;s
precious carpets with our muddy boots, where
a sockless Moor would shift his slippers.
And they have habits too which make for
bodily cleanliness, habits which they know
we have not, as, for instance, that of shaving
the hair from every part of the body but the
face. Our conversation was chiefly on comparisons
of customs, our host noticing that
we shaved our faces, the Moors their heads,
and we remarking&mdash;for he was too polite&mdash;that
we kept on our shoes when we entered
a house, whereas the Moors wore their fezzes
or their turbans. He said that he had
beheld in London the extraordinary sight
of a pair of ordinary Moorish slippers
set upon a table as an ornament; and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
had seen also the woman sultan, Queen
Victoria.</p>

<p>At Ramadan there are generally continual
street festivities during the eating
hours of the night; but the gloom cast over
the country by the presence of the French
kept these now to a minimum. There was
not even, in spite of the Sultan&#8217;s presence
any powder play, a thing which I was particularly
anxious to witness, to learn for
myself to what degree the Moors are hard
upon their animals. I know that Moslems
are seldom deliberately cruel; but I know,
too, that the vanity of the Moor makes him
ride with a cruel bit and a pointed spur that
could reach the vitals of a horse, and both of
these, I have heard, they employ in a vicious
manner in their famous, dashing powder
play. But most of their cruelty is only from
neglect, laziness, and ignorance. Camels wear
their shoulders and their necks through to the
bone&mdash;the sight is a common one&mdash;because
their masters do not trouble to pad their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
packs properly; two men will ride an undersized
donkey already overloaded with a pack;
and, as is the way among all Moslems, an
animal when it comes to die may suffer for
weeks or months, yet will not be killed
because &#8216;Allah gave life, and Allah alone
may take it away.&#8217; Still there is the Moorish
sect of <i>Aisawa</i>, that in a mad stampede tears
a sheep to pieces in the streets and eats it
still palpitating.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_126.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A CAMP OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF RABAT.</p>

<p>There were some interesting Englishmen
at Rabat, notably the <i>Times</i> correspondent,
W. B. Harris, who has travelled with several
Sultans of Morocco, and lived some time as a
Moor in order that he might learn their ways
and penetrate to the farthest reaches of the
country forbidden to the Christian. There
was also Mr. Allan Maclean, likewise an
authority on Morocco, now busy with the
Maghzen to arrange for the release of certain
prisoners, which Raisuli exacted as one of
the stipulations of Kaid Maclean&#8217;s release.
There was then the British Consul, George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Neroutsos, an old friend of the Sultan and a
man whom he often consults on matters of
European policy.</p>

<p>With some of the Englishmen we took
long rides around the town, passing several
times through the <i>m&#8217;halla</i>, where we were
never welcome; the camp of Abdul Aziz
was in sympathy with Mulai Hafid. We
saw the soldiers who were sent to fight
Hafid and joined his ranks with all their
arms. Gradually we saw the army dwindle
away until there could have been no more
than four thousand men between the discredited
Sultan and his hostile brother, whose
following of tribesmen was reported to
number variously from twenty to sixty
thousand men. Had the army of the French
not stood between them and fought the
Hafid <i>m&#8217;hallas</i>, Rabat would surely have
fallen and Abdul Aziz would now be a royal
prisoner safe in the keeping of his brother.
For want of money to pay the troops Abdul
Aziz was forced to pawn his jewels; and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
last, by a royal decree, he made good &#8216;a
hundred sacks&#8217; of silver coins that had been
confiscated as counterfeit. It was because of
a threatened revolt of the troops for want of
pay that the Spaniards in February occupied
the port of Mar Chica.</p>

<small>THE PIRATE CITY OF SALLI</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Across</span> the river from Rabat and across a
stretch of sand half-a-mile wide, a low line of
white battlements, showing but a single gate,
keeps the famous city of Salli, the headquarters
of the Moroccan pirates, who in
their day made themselves feared as far as
the shores of England. Every one remembers
that it was to Salli Robinson Crusoe was
taken and held in slavery for many months,
finally escaping in a small boat belonging to
his Moorish master. For years the corsairs
were the scourge of Christian merchantmen,
and up to two centuries ago they plied
their trade, which was deemed honourable
among the Moors and carried with it the title<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
&#8216;Amir-el-Bahr,&#8217; Lord of the Sea, from
which has come the English word Admiral.
It has been but a few years since Salli could
be visited by Europeans, and the inhabitants
boast to-day that not a Christian lives within
their sacred walls. They do not know that
the <i>Times</i> correspondent&mdash;of whom I have
spoken often already&mdash;once stayed amongst
them for some time; they remember only a
thin, studious, devout Moslem, who knew
the Koran and the history of Islam as they
did not, and had travelled to all the holy
places. Harris told me that greater hospitality
and truer courtesy could have been
shown him nowhere than among the descendants
of the Salli Rovers. But the deference,
I may add, was to the Moorish garb he
wore; to the man who wears the clothes of
an infidel, and, reversing their custom, shaves
his face and lets the hair grow on his head,
there is little common decency accorded.</p>

<p>Our man would not go with us alone to
Salli, though since leaving Casablanca he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
and his wife had taken refuge there with the
lady&#8217;s parents. To obtain an escort he took
us down to the custom-house where the
Basha of Salli came every day to watch the
imports. We arrived at the landing just as
the Basha got out of his ferry, a soldier
following him and also a servant carrying
his dinner in a plate slung in a napkin.
The governor was a stately Moor of middle
age, pock-marked of course, but clean and
intelligent-looking, and we addressed him
as a gentleman, to have our bow but slightly
acknowledged. To Driss, who spoke to him,
he intimated that because of the feeling
of the people at this moment he would rather
not be seen talking with Europeans. The
Basha then entered the custom-house, and
by means of Driss as messenger conducted
negotiations with us, still standing on the
landing-place. The negotiations were extensive
of course, and after half-an-hour,
receiving and replying to various unimportant
questions&mdash;Were we anxious to see Salli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
to-day? Would not to-morrow do as well?
Had we any reason for going there?&mdash;each of
which was delivered singly, at last a soldier
came and said that he would go with us but we
must wait till he went and fetched another.
This is the way when one is not welcome.</p>

<p>Finally permitted to cross the river, we
ploughed through the sands and passed the
boneyard outside the walls to the narrow
gate, where we waited again till yet another
soldier came; and in this order, one man
in front and two behind us, we entered upon
the sacred cobbled streets, now not too
crowded, for it was Ramadan, when folk are
active most at evening and before the sun
is high. In the quarter of good homes,
through which we passed first, only little
children in the care of youthful slave girls
seemed to be abroad; and it is hard to say
which we most alarmed. There was in
every instance first a surprised start, then
a quiet flurry. Little girls in long dresses,
wearing but one long earring and distinguishable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
from boys only by having two
patches of hair on their otherwise shaven
heads, would shift their slippers, grab them
up in their hands, and go tearing off, their
cloaks flying, to disappear into a broad, low,
arched doorway, and down the steps behind.
The black girls, older, snatched the babies
they were tending, covered their faces, and
shuffled off to call the women. As we
passed, the single uncovered eye of many
women, white and black, lined the door held
an inch ajar, and once, at our glance, one of
the women growing modest slammed the
heavy thing and&mdash;we judged from the yell&mdash;caught
the nose of one of her sisters.
Sometimes they came and peered over from
their low-walled roofs, pointing us out to
their children, the first infidels perhaps many
of them had seen; and on these occasions
we always watched, for the streets were
sometimes but a yard wide and we were
easy marks had any of them spat.</p>

<p>There can be no mistake about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
records of history, which state that thousands
of Christian slaves, many of them
British, were sold on the great white market
at Salli. The faces of many of the people
to-day are distinctly European. Here there
seemed to me to be less mixture of black
blood than in the other towns, many of the
people being as white as Europeans. We
saw among the children a boy of five or six
years who would not have looked unnatural
in Ireland, and later, in the <i>mella</i> we came
across a little girl with golden hair. At this
last we puzzled our brains&mdash;for our inquiries
brought no explanation&mdash;finally surmising
that some rich Jew, a hundred years ago,
had bought her ancestor.</p>

<p>In the centre of the town is a cone-shaped
hill crowded with white, square
houses of the best class, which range themselves
round a mosque and minaret upon
the summit. The massive tower, inlaid with
tiles of many colours, once served as beacon
for the pirates, though now, like all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Moorish coast, it sheds no light for Christian
ships. When we asked to see the great
mosque, our soldiers made excuses and
would have led us another way, but we
adopted the method of turning at the corners
that we chose, leaving the man in the lead to
double back from the way he would set. Of
course he always protested, but from experience
with other escorts we knew that to see
what is to be seen in Mohammedan countries
one must lead the way oneself, and the
greater the protest of the guard the more
one can be certain that one is on the proper
track. The soldiers were anxious to take us
promptly to the <i>mella</i>, where we might stay,
they said, as long as we pleased; but first
we searched out the mosque and later the
market-place. The Sok here is in itself by
no means so imposing as at Laraiche or
even at Rabat, and there are to be seen no
characters that are not also at the open
ports; but here there gather Moors and
Arabs and Berbers of an intenser religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
ardour, who follow closer the customs of
the ages past and whose very faces show
their greater hatred of the Nazarene.</p>

<p>The people of Salli&mdash;largely for their
intolerance of Christians and their glorious
rover ancestry&mdash;hold a social position second
only to that of the people of Fez and the holy
city of Ouzzan, and they are wealthier as a
rule than the inhabitants of other towns; and
these are reasons that holy men and maimed
creatures flock here to beg. But at the time
of our visit the presence of the Sultan at
Rabat had drawn all wanderers, beggars,
saints, minstrels, and itinerant tradesmen,
across the river, and on the Sok of Salli
there was but one poor bard to stop his story
at sight of our unholy apparition. He stopped
and refused to go on, and the people murmuring
began to move off, while our soldiers
urged us to pass on with them.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_136.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">SHAWIA TRIBESMEN.</p>

<p>The walls of the <i>mella</i> were but a few
hundred yards away, and there we repaired
at last, where crowds who followed us were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
beaten back only to prevent annoyance. We
could stop and speak with the Jews and
enter their synagogues and even their houses,
and they would pose for photographs, though
many of them now saw a camera for the first
time. Having taken refuge here from the
Spanish Inquisition of the fifteenth century
the Jews of Morocco might be expected to
harbour prejudices against the Christian
world, but, strangely, nowhere, not in the
heart of the closed country, are they at all
fanatic.</p>

<p>A drove of boys and men, with women
trailing on behind, followed us as we left their
walled reservation, and would have come
beyond but for the Moorish keeper of their
gate, who raised his stick and shouting drove
them back. It is the law at night that all
Jews must be inside the <i>mella</i> when the gates
are closed at seven or eight o&#8217;clock; and
this good rule is for their safety, that they
may not suffer robbery and abuse. The Jews
of Morocco, oppressed and often robbed, pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the country&#8217;s fighting men for their protection;
in Moorish towns they pay the basha,
in the country they pay the kaid or other
chief of the strongest neighbouring tribe.
They are protected too by the Government,
because they are thrifty and can be made to
pay, under pressure, heavy taxes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>MANY WIVES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were up on the Kasbah, the high rocky
citadel that rises nearly two hundred feet
straight above the notorious bar of the Bu
Regreg, taking in a splendid view of the
river&#8217;s winding course together with the city
of Salli. When a caravan of unusual size
twisted out of Salli&#8217;s double gate and came
across the sands to the water&#8217;s edge, where
a score of ferry boats nosed the bank, their
owners began jumping about like madmen,
frantic for the promised trade that could not
escape them. On market days at Rabat
there are always camel trains and pack trains
of mules and horses crossing these sands of
Salli to and from the barges that ferry them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
over the river for a farthing a man and two
farthings a camel, but they seldom come in
trains of more than twenty. This winding
white company, detached in groups of sometimes
four, sometimes forty, stretched from
the wall to the water&#8217;s edge, a distance of
half a mile; it spread out on the shore, and
still kept coming from the gate. Neither
Weare nor I had heard that the Sultan&#8217;s
harem would arrive this day, and we had to
reproach our faithful Driss Wult el Kaid, to
whom we had given standing orders to move
round among his countrymen and let us know
when things of interest were happening.</p>

<p>&#8216;Plenty time, Mr. Moore,&#8217; said Driss,
holding up his brown hands and chuckling.
&#8216;There are many, many; more &#8217;an three
hundred, and many soldiers, and many
Soudanese,&#8217; by which last Driss meant
slaves. There was indeed plenty of time;
it took the company all that day and part of
the next to cross by the slow, heavy barges,
carrying twenty people and half-a-dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
animals at each load, and rowed generally
by two men, sometimes by only one.</p>

<p>We descended from the Kasbah and made
our way down the street of shops, the Sok or
market street, as it is called, and out through
the Water Port to the rock-studded sands
upon which the caravan was landing. It was
an extraordinary sight. The tide was out,
and the water, which at high tide laps the
greenish walls, now left a sloping shore of
twenty yards. The boats when loaded
would push up the river close to the other
shore, then taking the current off a prominent
point, swing over in an arc to the Rabat
side. Empty, they would go back the same
way by an inner arc. On our side they ran
aground generally between two rocks, when
the black, bare-legged eunuchs, dropping
their slippers, would elevate their skirts by
taking up a reef at the belts, and jump into
the water to take the women to dry land on
their stalwart backs. Only in rare instances
did much of the woman&#8217;s face show&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
then she was a pretty woman and young;
those old or pock-marked were always careful
to cover, even to the extent of hiding one
eye. Nevertheless the wives of the Sultan
as they got upon the backs of his slaves
gathered their <i>sulhams</i> up about their knees,
displaying part of a leg, in almost every case
unstockinged, and always dangling a heelless
slipper of red native leather. In Morocco,
as I have indicated before, the costumes of
men and those of women are practically the
same except for fullness and, in the case of
nether-garments, colour. The short trousers
of a man, for instance, are generally brown
and his slippers never anything (when new)
but yellow.</p>

<p>The Sultan&#8217;s wives with few exceptions
were covered in white <i>sulhams</i>; round their
heads were bands of blue ribbon knotted at
the back, fixing their hoods and veils for
riding. While the slaves brought up the
luggage, working with a will like men conducting
their own business, the women held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
the mules and horses, covered with wads of
blanket, all of Ottoman red, and mounted
with high red Arab saddles. The women
were usually subdued and to all appearances
modest, though all of them would let their
black eyes look upon the infidels longer than
would the modest maid of a race that goes
unveiled. But of course we were a sight to
them not of every day. Now and then a
lady whose robe was of better quality than
most, seemed distressed about some jewel
case or special piece of luggage, and worried
her servant, who argued back in a manner of
authority. It was evident the slaves had
charge each of a particular lady for whom he
was responsible.</p>

<p>As soon as these blacks had gathered
their party and belongings all together, they
loaded the tents and trunks two to a mule,
and lifted the women into the high red
saddles, always ridden astride; then, picking
up their guns, they started on to the palace,
leading the animals through the ancient gate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
and across the crowded town, shouting
&#8216;Balak! Balak!&#8217; Make way, make way!
Once they had begun to move, the eunuchs
paid no attention to any man, not deigning
even to reply to the dog of a boatman who
often followed them some hundred paces
cursing them for having paid too little, sometimes
nothing at all, when much was expected
for ferrying the <i>Lai-ell</i> of the Sultan.</p>

<p>The caravan had been a long time on the
road from Fez. Travelling only part of the
day and camping early, it had taken a fortnight
to come a distance little more than 150
miles. The Sultan had brought with him
twenty of his favourites, trailing them across
country rapidly, when he had hurried to this
strategic place at the news that Mulai Hafid
had been proclaimed Sultan at his southern
capital and would probably race him to
Rabat.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_144.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A FEW OF THE SULTAN&#8217;S WIVES.</p>

<p>But why Abdul Aziz brought with him
any of his wives is a question. Perhaps
they had more to do with it than had he;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
and perhaps it was for political reasons. At
any rate (I have it from the Englishman
quoted before) his harem bores him; to the
songs and dances of all his beauties he much
prefers the conversation of a single European
who can tell him how a field gun works,
what it is that makes the French&mdash;or any
other&mdash;war balloon rise, and explain to him
the pictures in the French and English
weeklies to which he subscribes. He has
here a motor-boat, which he keeps high and
dry in a room in the palace, and the German
engineer who makes its wheel go round is a
frequent companion.</p>

<p>It is said in Morocco that while other
Sultans visited their wives all in turn, showing
favouritism to none, the present youthful
High Shereef has cut off all but half a score,
and never sees the mass of them except <i>en
masse</i>. And it is said, too&mdash;among the many
current stories regarding his European
tendencies&mdash;that for these ten ladies he has
spent thousands of pounds on Paris gowns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
and Paris hats to dress them in and see what
European women look like. It naturally
suggests itself that the poor fellow is hopelessly
puzzled, and on a point that would of
course catch his scientific mind: while the
women of Paris are apparently built in two
parts and pivoted together, those of his own
dominions are constructed the other way.
According to the ideas of the Orient the
waist should be the place of largest circumference.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>GOD SAVE THE SULTAN!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal cause of the Moorish revolution,
which threatens to terminate the reign
of Abdul Aziz, was his tendency&mdash;up to a
few months ago&mdash;to defy the religious prejudices
which a long line of terrible predecessors
had carefully nurtured in his people.
The incident of the mosque of Mulai Idris at
Fez was his culminating offence. To the
uttermost corners of the Empire went the
news that the young Sultan had defiled the
most holy tomb of the country through
causing to be taken by force from its sacred
protection and murdered one of the Faithful
who had slain a Christian dog. To the
punishing wrath of the dishonoured saint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
and of the Almighty has been put down
every calamity that has since befallen either
the Sultan or the Empire; and the Moors
will tell you that by this act has come the
ruin of Morocco. It was in dramatic fashion
that the feeling Driss, our man, stopped
abruptly in the street when I mentioned the
affair. We were nearing a picturesque little
mosque with a leaning palm towering above
it, and good old Driss was urging me to turn
away and not to pass it&mdash;because he was a
friend of mine and did not want me stoned.
&#8216;Driss,&#8217; said I, &#8216;they would not dare; the
Sultan is here and they know that even a
mosque won&#8217;t save them if they harm a
European now.&#8217; Driss stopped short and
turned upon me. &#8216;You know that, Mr.
Moore,&#8217; he said with emphasis, &#8216;that about
the Mulai Idris! That was the finish of
Morocco!&#8217;</p>

<p>While with such breaches of the Moslem
law Abdul Aziz has roused among the people
a superstitious fear of consequences, he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
also, by lesser defiances of recognised Moorish
customs, sorely aggravated them. His many
European toys&mdash;the billiard table, the costly
photographic apparatus, the several bicycles,
and the extravagant displays of fireworks&mdash;while
harmless enough, were regarded by the
Moors with no good grace. But worst of
all these trivial things was, to the Moors, the
young man&#8217;s evident lack of dignity. At
times he would ride out alone and with
Christians (who were his favourite companions),
whereas the Sultans before him were
hardly known to appear in public without
the shade of the authoritative red umbrella.</p>

<p>An Englishman who knows Abdul Aziz
and has for years advised him, tells me of a
ride they took together accompanied only by
their private servants, when the Court was
formerly at Rabat, five years ago. The
Sultan left the palace grounds with the hood
of his <i>jeleba</i> drawn well down over his face,
his servant likewise thoroughly covered in
the garment that levels all Moors, men and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
women, to the same ghost-like appearance.
Sultan and man met the Englishman outside
the town walls at the ruins of Shella, a
secluded place grown over with cactus
bushes, and rode with him on into the
country fifteen miles or more. On the way
back they encountered a storm of rain, and
drenched to the skin, their horses floundering
in the slipping clay, they drew up at the back
walls of the palace and tried to get an
entrance by a gate always barred.</p>

<p>&#8216;What shall we do?&#8217; asked the Sultan.</p>

<p>&#8216;Get your servant to climb the wall,&#8217; said
the Englishman.</p>

<p>&#8216;No; you get yours,&#8217; said Abdul Aziz,
always contrary.</p>

<p>So the Englishman&#8217;s servant climbed the
wall, dropped on the other side, and made his
way to the palace, where he was promptly
arrested and flogged for a lying thief, no one
taking the trouble to go to see if his tale was
true. After the Sultan and the Englishman
had waited for some time, they rode round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
to another gate and entered. Then the unfortunate
servant of the Christian was set
free and given five dollars Hassani to heal
his welted skin.</p>

<p>But things have changed. On the present
visit of the Sultan to Rabat he no longer
rides out except in great State; and this he
does (on the advice partly of that particular
Englishman of the wall adventure) every
Friday regularly.</p>

<p>In September, while Abdul Aziz was on
the road from Fez, hastening to anticipate his
brother in getting to this, the war capital of
Morocco (where, as the Moors say, the
Sultan might listen with both ears, to the
North and to the South), public criers from
the rival camp of Mulai Hafid declared that
Abdul Aziz was coming to the coast to be
baptized a Christian under the guns of the
infidel men-of-war. But this lie was easy to
refute without the humiliation of a deliberate
contradiction. Though at Fez it has always
been the custom of the Sultan to worship at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
a private mosque within the grounds of his
palace, it is likewise the custom for him at
Rabat to go with a great fanfare and all his
household and the Maghzen through lines of
troops as long as he can muster, to a great
public mosque in the open fields between
the town&#8217;s outer and inner walls.</p>

<p>It was with a party of Europeans,
mostly English correspondents, that I went
to see the first Selamlik here. In the party
there was W. B. Harris of the <i>Times</i>, and
Wm. Maxwell of the <i>Mail</i>, as well as Allan
Maclean, the brother of the Kaid. We had
as an escort two soldiers from the British
Consulate, without whom we could not have
moved. The soldiers led the way shouting
&#8216;Balak! balak!&#8217; as we rode through the
narrow crowded streets. But in all the
throng no other Europeans were to be seen,
until some way out we met at a cross-road
and mingled for a moment with the delegation
of French officials and correspondents,
bound also for the great show.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Passing the <i>Bab-el-Had</i>, the Gate of
Heads (fortunately not decorated at this
time), the road led through grassy fields
to a height from which is visible the whole
palace enclosure. We could see, over the
high white walls, the two lines of stacked
muskets sweeping away in a long, opening
arc from the narrow gate beside the mosque
to the numerous doors of the low white-washed
palace. Behind the guns the soldiers
sat, generally in groups on the grass,
only a few having life enough to play at any
game. Considerably in the background
were groups of women, garbed consistently
in white, and heavily veiled.</p>

<p>Our soldiers, always glad to spur a horse,
climbed through a break in the cactus that
lined the road and led a hard canter down
the slight, grassy slope, straight for one of
the smaller gates. Two sentries seated on
either side, perceiving us, rose nervously,
retired and swung the doors in our faces,
the rusty bars grating into place as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
drew up. Our soldiers shouted, but got no
answer, and we rode round to the <i>Bab</i> by the
mosque, which could not be closed. As we
drew up here a sentinel with arbitrary
power let in two negro boys, clad each in
a ragged shirt, riding together on a single
dwarfed donkey not tall enough to keep
their long, black, dangling legs out of the
dust. But we could not pass&mdash;no; there
was no use arguing, we could not pass.
Slaves went in and beggars; the man was
anxious, and shoved them in&mdash;but no; we,
we were not French!</p>

<p>While our soldiers argued, the Frenchmen
came up and passed in; then the guard,
seeing we looked much like them, changed
his mind and permitted us, too, to enter.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_154b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ABDUL AZIZ ENTERING HIS PALACE.</p>

<p>For some distance we passed between
the lines of stacked guns, attracting the
curious gaze of everybody, especially the
women, who rose and came nearer the soldiers.
One youth, a mulatto, got up and
took a gun from a stack, and pretending to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
shove a cartridge into it, aimed directly at
my head. The incident was, as one of the
Englishmen suggested, somewhat boring.</p>

<p>Within a hundred yards of the palace we
got behind the line and took up our stand.
We had not long to wait. Shortly after
the sun began to decline a twanging blast
from a brassy cornet brought the field to
its feet.</p>

<p>There was no hurry or scurry&mdash;there
seldom is in Mohammedan countries. The
soldiers took their guns, not with any order
but without clashing; the women and children
came up close; tribesmen, mounted,
drew up behind. The Sultan&#8217;s band, in
white, belted dresses, with knee skirts, bare
legs, yellow slippers, and red fezzes, began
to play a slow, impressive march&mdash;&#8216;God
save the King!&#8217; with strange Oriental variations.
It would not have been well if the
Moors had known, and our soldier, for one,
was amazed when we told him, that the band
played the Christian Sultan&#8217;s hymn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>The mongrel soldiers, black and brown
and white, slaves and freemen, presented
arms uncertainly, as best they knew how;
the white-robed women &#8216;coo-eed&#8217; loud and
shrill. A line of spear-bearers, all old men,
passed at a short jog-trot; following them
came six Arab horses, not very fine, but
exceedingly fat, and richly caparisoned, led
by skirted grooms; then the Sultan, immediately
preceded and followed by private
servants, likewise in white, except for their
chief, a coal-black negro dressed in richest
red. Beside the Sultan, who was robed in
white and rode a white horse, walked on
one side the bearer of the red parasol, and
on the other a tall dark Arab who flicked a
long scarf to keep flies off his Imperial
Majesty. In and out of the ranks, disturbing
whom he chose, ran a mad man, bellowing
hideously, foaming at the mouth. This,
on the part of Abdul Aziz, was indeed
humouring the prejudices of the people.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>MANY SULTANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is generally put down to the weakness of
Abdul Aziz that Morocco has come to its
present pass, and there is no doubt that had
the youthful Sultan possessed a little more
of firmness he would not have come now to
be a mere dependent of the French. But
Morocco has long been doomed. Even in
the days of the former Sultan, who ruled the
Moors as they understood and gave them a
government the likes of which they say they
wish they had to-day, the tribes were constantly
at war with one another and with
him. Continual rebellions in Morocco proper
left Mulai Hassan no time to subdue the
Berber tribes to the south, nominally his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
subjects; and when in his age he set upon
a long-projected pilgrimage to the birthplace
of his dynasty, Tafilet, he could venture
across the Atlas mountains only after emissaries
had begged or bought from the Berbers
the right of way.</p>

<p>The tragic death of Mulai Hassan while
on the march, and the manner in which the
throne was saved to Abdul Aziz, his favourite
son, made graphic reading in the summer of
1894; and they will serve to-day to illustrate
the sad, chaotic state of the whole poor
Moorish empire. The old Sultan was not
well when he returned from Tafilet, but
serious disorders throughout the country
allowed him to rest at Marakesh, his southern
capital, only a few months. Proposing to
move on to Rabat, thence to Fez, punishing
lawless and rebellious tribes that had risen
while he was away, he set out from Marakesh
with an army composed of many hostile
elements, conscripts kept together largely by
their awe of him and hope of loot. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
came to but the first rebellious district, that
of the Tedla tribes, when Mulai Hassan fell
seriously ill and was unable to go on. But
after several days the news was spread one
morning that he had sufficiently recovered
and would proceed. Only the viziers and a
few slaves&mdash;who held their tongues to save
their heads&mdash;knew that Mulai Hassan was
dead.</p>

<p>For a day the body, seated within the
royal palanquin, was borne along in state,
preceded as usual by many banners, the line
of spear-bearers, and the six led horses, and
flanked by the bearer of the parasol and the
black who flicks the silken scarf. Though speed
was imperative the usual halts were made
that no suspicion should arise. In the morning
at ten o&#8217;clock, the Sultan&#8217;s usual breakfast
time, the army stopped, a tent was pitched,
and into it the palanquin was carried. Food
was cooked and green tea brewed and taken
in, to be brought out again as if they had
been tasted. At night the royal band played<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
before the Sultan&#8217;s vast enclosure. But the
secret was not to be kept long in a climate
like that of Morocco in summer; and lest the
corpse should tell its own tale, at the end of
a long day&#8217;s march, as the army pitched its
camp in the evening, the news went out,
spreading like a wave through the company,
that the Sultan was dead, and that Abdul
Aziz was the Sultan, having been the choice
of his father.</p>

<p>In an hour the camp split up into a
hundred parties, each distrustful of some
other. There was not a tribe but had some
blood feud with another, and now the reason
for the truce that had held hitherto was
gone. Men of the same tribe banded
together for defence and marched together
at some distance from the others; conscripts
from the neighbouring districts, or districts to
the south, took their leave; private interests
actuated now where awe and fear had held
before. Soon the news got to the country,
and the tribes through which the <i>m&#8217;halla</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
passed began to cut off stragglers, to plunder
where they could and drive off animals that
strayed.</p>

<p>By forced marches the army at last
arrived at Rabat, and those of the tribesmen
who cared to halt pitched their camp on the
hills outside the walls. Promptly that night
the Sultan&#8217;s body, accompanied by a single
shereef and surrounded by a small contingent
of foot-soldiers, was passed into the town
through a hole in the wall&mdash;a dead man, it is
said, never going in through the gates&mdash;and
was entombed, as is the custom with Sultans,
in a mosque. In the morning, when the
people bestirred themselves to see the entry
of the dead Hassan, they saw instead the
new Sultan, then sixteen years of age, led
forth on his father&#8217;s great white horse, and,
shading him, the crimson parasol marking his
authority.</p>

<p>The secrecy that had been maintained
was not intended only to keep the <i>m&#8217;halla</i>
intact; primarily the object was to ensure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
succession of the youth then at Rabat, the
nearest capital. Had the Maghzen been in
the proximity of Fez or Marakesh, in spite of
the Moorish law that passes on the succession
to the Shereef of the dead man&#8217;s choice,
Abdul Aziz might not have been the Sultan
of Morocco. Uncles and rival brothers he
had many, and high pretenders of other
shereefian families might soon have risen.
It was therefore important for the viziers
themselves that the succession should come
as a <i>coup d&#8217;&eacute;tat</i>, and that they should be on
hand to support it with as much of the army
as they could hold together.</p>

<p class="caption">A PRINCELY KAID.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_162b.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE ROYAL BAND.</p>

<p>There were, of course, many heads to be
cut off, both politically and physically. Mulai
Omar (a son of Hassan by a negro slave and
therefore half-brother of Abdul Aziz) secured
the acknowledgment of Aziz in the great
mosques at Fez, where he held the authority
of Khalif, but later behaved in a most
suspicious manner. A black boy whom he
sent to stop the bands from celebrating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
accession, being defied, drove his knife into
a drum; and for this the hand that did the
work was flayed and salted and the fingers
bound together closed, until they grew fast to
the palm and left the hand for ever a useless
stump. Mulai Omar himself was made a
royal prisoner, as was his brother Mulai
Mohammed, Khalif of the southern capital
(who has been released only within the past
few weeks in order, it is reported, that he
might take command of the army against
Hafid, the trusted brother who became
Khalif of Marakesh and governed there for
many years, until recently, after the affair at
Casablanca, when he essayed to become
Sultan himself).</p>

<p>In the ranks of the viziers there was also
trouble; Sid Akhmed ben Musa, the <i>Hajib</i>
or Chamberlain, trusted of Hassan and also
of the young Sultan&#8217;s mother, who possessed
unusual power, became protector of Abdul
Aziz; whereupon, for the safety of his own
position if not from jealousy, Sid Akhmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
caused to be removed from office most of his
fellow viziers, filling their places with his own
brothers and men who would do his bidding.
The dismissal of the fallen viziers was followed
by their prompt arrest, and all their
property was confiscated, not excepting their
concubines and slaves. From a palace
second only to that of the Sultan, the Grand
Vizier, Haj Amaati (who had plundered the
country in the most barbarous fashion and
put his money in property, there being no
banks), went to prison in a single shirt, and
a mongrel beggar swapped caps with him as
he was dragged bound through the streets.</p>

<p>Sid Akhmed ruled as dictator, suppressing
wayward tribes by vigorous means, as well,
probably, as anyone not a Sultan could, until
the year 1900, when he died. The young
Sultan, then being twenty-two, assumed alone
the power of his office, to rule the country in
a feeble, half-hearted way, his object, it would
seem, more to entertain himself than to improve
the condition of his passing empire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Morocco needs a tyrant, for tyranny is the
only law it knows; yet Abdul Aziz, raised to
believe himself enlightened, and having no
taste for brutality, has endeavoured to govern
easily.</p>

<p>He was brought up by his mother, a Circassian
of evident taste and refinement, much in
the manner of a European child. Kept within
her sight and shielded from immorality, he
grew up pure and most unlike his many
brothers. In all Morocco there was no company
for him. In mind there was nothing in
common between him and any of his household.
Even his women, brought as presents
from the corners of the country, some from
Constantinople, had for him only temporary
charm. It was natural that a young
man of his temperament and education,
trained to abhor the vices and the crimes to
which the Moors are given over, should
become more interested in Western things,
and should seek to reform his country. But
Abdul Aziz had been weakened as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
preserved by his training, and when he came
to authority it was without the determination
and without the courage of his youth and of
his race. In no sympathy with his Court or
with his countrymen, it was natural for him
to surround himself with men with whom he
could be intimate, and the retinue that he
acquired were Europeans, mostly Englishmen.</p>

<p>European things, which were to him as
toys, began to fascinate him, and his purchase
of them soon became a scandal in Morocco.
Bicycles, motor-cars, cameras, phonographs,
wireless telegraphs, and Western animals for
his zoo, were ordered by the Sultan on hearing
of them. An English billiard table was
brought from the coast on a primitive
wooden truck built specially, for it was too
heavy to bring camel-back and there are no
carts in Morocco. The Sultan could not go
to Europe, but Europe could come to the
Sultan. He heard of fireworks and gave a
lavish order, engaging also a &#8216;master of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
fireworks&#8217; to conduct displays in his gardens.
He bought a camera made of gold and
engaged a photographer. Of course the
Sultan&#8217;s extravagant purchases attracted to
Fez many Europeans bent only on exploiting
him. Hundreds of thousands he spent on
jewels, which when deposited in the Bank of
England brought for him a loan of about a
tenth the original cost. He bought a motor-boat
and kept it high and dry in his palace,
though he employed a German engineer to
run it. From the Krupp company, at a cost
of many millions, he bought two heavy-calibre
guns, as unmanageable to the Moors as white
elephants to monkeys. Any agent for European
arms could get an order from him, and
his arsenal became a museum of European
guns.</p>

<p>It was easy to swindle the Sultan. An
American came to Fez to persuade him to
send &#8216;a Moorish village&#8217; to the Exposition
at St Louis. Being unaccredited, the man
could get no proper introduction from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
American Minister at Tangier, but by a
clever ruse he saw the Sultan nevertheless.
The American brought with him to Fez a
bulldog with false teeth. Through some of
his European <i>entourage</i> the Sultan heard of
the dog and ordered it to be brought to him;
but the dog could not go without its master,
who obtained from the Sultan some 40,000<i>l.</i>,
spending, I am told, perhaps 2,000<i>l.</i> on the
Moorish village.</p>

<p>While spending money in this fashion&mdash;which
might in itself have made Morocco
bankrupt&mdash;Abdul Aziz took no trouble to collect
his taxes. To bring to order a tribe careless
about paying them, it is often necessary for
the Sultan to lead his forces in person. But
Abdul Aziz after one or two campaigns left
his army to the command of Ministers; and
gradually his troops dwindled away, and, his
moral force weakening, gradually, tribe by
tribe, almost the entire country discontinued
to pay taxes. At last only the garrison
towns could be depended on for revenue.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>News of his European tendencies spread
throughout the land. The influence of Kaid
Maclean in the army was known and resented.
Photographs of the Sultan had been seen by
many of the Faithful. Finally, it was reported
that he had become a Christian.</p>

<p>In 1902 a pretender, Bu Hamara, proclaimed
himself Sultan, and established his
claim to divine appointment by feats of legerdemain.
According to a story current among
Europeans, one of his &#8216;tricks,&#8217; in gruesome
keeping with the country&#8217;s cruelty, was the
burying of a live slave with a reed for him
to speak and breathe through. Bu Hamara
by this means called a voice from the grave,
and after he had called it, placed his foot
upon the tube. When the grave was opened
the slave was found really to be dead.</p>

<p>Bu Hamara came near to capturing Fez.</p>

<p>Raisuli rose to power and successfully
defied the Maghzen forces.</p>

<p>With Abdul Aziz things went from bad
to worse, till, hopelessly bankrupt, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
following of perhaps ten thousand men,
mostly volunteers, he came to Rabat in September
of last year, roused to this move
when his brother Hafid was proclaimed at
Marakesh. Since then Fez has also proclaimed
Hafid, and the army that came with
Aziz has dwindled away, until it numbers now
hardly four thousand men. Besides these he
has but the petty garrisons, who find it convenient
to remain in the barracks of coast
towns.</p>

<p>Abdul Aziz, now thirty years of age, is a
pale-faced quadroon with a black, immature
beard and a thin moustache. He is above
medium height and well built, of a healthy
though not athletic appearance. His manner
in the presence of official visitors is seldom
easy; his words are few and constrained.
With private guests whom he knows, however,
he is gay and often familiar. He
speaks gently and slowly, I am told, occasionally
placing his hand on one&#8217;s shoulder,
and all who know him like him. He seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
anxious that things shall go well, but he is
more a student than a man of action. He is
vain of his enlightenment, of which he has a
somewhat exalted opinion; and he is jealous
of his prerogatives. He tells Europeans
who visit him that his brother Hafid (who is
almost black), was of course brought up differently
from himself, that while possessing some
good qualities, he is of course a man of little
education, and that his head has been turned
to declare himself Sultan. Abdul Aziz says
he will not punish Hafid&mdash;when the rebellion
is put down and he is captured&mdash;except to
imprison him in some princely palace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The historic empire of Morocco has to
all intents come to an end. Whether the
French or a combination of European Powers
control hereafter, it remains that the once
great empire has passed as an independent
State. In name perhaps its independence
will survive for many years; the Sultan
Abdul Aziz may return to Fez and gain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
again, with the aid of the French, the loyalty
of the interior that is lost to him; and he
may&mdash;he will, no doubt, he or another Sultan&mdash;continue
to conduct negotiations with
foreign countries. But his control of his
own land will be hereafter as of a man on an
allowance from the revenues that will go to
his creditors, chiefly to France and Spain,
and his dealings with other Powers must be
for the future in obedience to dictation from
those creditors.</p>

<p>As an empire with vassal States, Morocco
has passed indeed these many years; as an
independent country, it is to-day little more
than an unproductive territory peopled
sparsely with disunited tribes, acclaiming
several Sultans, supporting none, warring
hopelessly against invaders. Like Turkey-in-Europe,
this backward State on the
borders of civilisation has long been doomed.
Abdul Aziz made some feeble attempts to
graft upon it Western institutions; but the
change can be wrought by Western forces
only and with modern arms.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>THE BRITISH IN MOROCCO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> very many of the European residents of
Morocco are fond of the French invaders.
Even, in many instances, Frenchmen hate
them. They condemn consistently the disorders
that the armies of France&mdash;the Spanish
are not very active&mdash;have brought to Morocco;
and still more they lament the influx
of other Europeans, generally, as they point
out, of the worst sort; dishonest speculators,
adventurers and &#8216;dive&#8217; keepers, unfortunately
the usual vanguard of Western civilisation.
Frenchmen of the old days are wont to sentimentalise
about the &#8216;Moghreb defiled&#8217;;
Germans have no love for the soldiers of
France; Englishmen resent the subordinate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
position, which for three years they have
been required to take.</p>

<p>In Eastern countries where Europeans
are few, there is always intense rivalry and
much bitter feeling between the races. In
Morocco the great jealousy, until the signing
of the Anglo-French agreement, was
between the British and the French. For
many years the agents of France and those
of England, consuls as well as diplomatists,
merchants, and even simple residents, had
struggled against each other for trade, for
social prestige, and for greater influence with
the Sultan and the Moorish government.
When the British Minister would go to Fez,
the Frenchman was always prompt on his
heels; nor did the former&mdash;though perhaps
with more show of modesty&mdash;ever allow the
Minister of France to get to his credit an
extra visit or a larger present.</p>

<p>The intimacy between Kaid Maclean and
the Sultan grievously annoyed the French,
and they accused the Kaid of exploiting Abdul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Aziz. On the other hand, though the Kaid
was in the employ of the Sultan, he was
engaged also to act as agent of the British
government at the Maghzen. In loans and
contracts the conflict was generally more
between the Germans and the French; and
on these occasions scandals of rival bribery
and of diplomatic influence being brought to
bear in the interests of the rival bankers or
contractors, as the case might be, were
always rife. British Ministers do not often
aid the subjects of the King in gathering
private contracts, and British interest in
Morocco has always been primarily political.
British trade with Morocco, actual or potential,
was never of any considerable importance&mdash;except
to the British traders in the
towns of the coast, to whom the rivalry of
course extended, growing often more acute.</p>

<p>In 1904 all this was changed by a stroke
of the pen. England and France came to
an understanding, the one waiving claims in
Egypt, the other withdrawing politically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
from Morocco. The following year the
German Emperor, who had not been consulted,
volunteered an objection to the
French scheme for policing certain coast
cities and border towns and organising
a Morocco State Bank. Intimidating the
French&mdash;though Great Britain &#8216;agreed to
support them in any attitude they should
take,&#8217; which meant, I am convinced, even to
the extent of war with Germany&mdash;the Kaiser
brought about a conference of the Powers,
which came to be known by the name of
the Spanish town at which it was held. The
Algeciras Conference, after deliberating for
months, finally in compromise decreed that
France should be accompanied by Spain in
her scheme, which was definitely limited.</p>

<p>The accord between France and England
was a blow to British residents in
Morocco. As long as they had been in the
land they had held, in the fear and the
regard of the Moors, the paramount position,
and now that position was handed over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
their foremost rivals. They felt that they
as Englishmen could not consistently change
their attitude at the dictation of their
Government at home&mdash;nor did they change
except for the worse.</p>

<p>Their jealousy has now turned to enmity,
which is often intense. In the smaller towns
French and British consular agents are not
on speaking terms and avoid each other in
the streets. Englishmen are friendly with
the Germans, upholding the anti-French
policy of the German Government and
decrying the &#8216;weakness&#8217; of their own, all
the while sympathising with the unfortunate
Moor and his disintegrating empire. To
the large towns new consuls have been
sent out, generally from both France and
England, and new Ministers have gone to
Tangier, and this makes things easier in
diplomatic circles, where the French policy is
supported consistently. Otherwise the same
old merchants and residents are there, both
French and English, with the same old hates.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>How the Englishman rails against his
Government! How he storms at the English
Press! How he writes, in passionate language,
in his <i>Moghreb al Aksa</i>, the little weekly
English paper! I have in mind a thin, wiry
little man, past middle age, who wears a
helmet and dresses in a brown suit of tweeds.
Having plenty of leisure he puts in much
of his time writing for London papers; but
they will have none of his spirited essays.
So he prints them in the <i>Moghreb</i>. They
are headed, &#8216;How Long Will England
Close Her Eyes?&#8217; &#8216;How Long Will the
English Press Refuse to Print the Truth?&#8217;
&#8216;How Long Will the Patient Moor Refrain
from Massacre?&#8217;&mdash;and such like. I suggested
to him one evening as we sat with several
other Europeans at a table at a new French
caf&eacute; (it was not thoroughly consistent for the
little man to patronise the place) that in all
Morocco there were hardly enough Europeans
to make a massacre, as massacres go in
the East; were there fifty bon&acirc;-fide Britishers
in the land?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Fifty or a million, he replied vehemently,
they had been sold by the Government at
home. What an absurd thing to do, to hold
the high hand in Morocco and pass it over
to the French for relinquishing some paper
claim on Egypt! But what could be expected
from a man like the Earl of Lansdowne,
himself half French? It was no use
pointing out that the British Government on
this occasion had sacrificed a few British
subjects for what appeared to be the good
of the many; that British exports to Morocco
had never amounted to more than two
millions a year; that the potential value of
the country is not promising; that the French
are treaty-bound to keep the open door;
that the cost to France in money, to say
nothing of blood, may never be repaid with
revenues or even with trade.</p>

<p>That the French will ever withdraw from
Morocco is exceedingly doubtful, and this is
a sore grievance to British residents, who
long hoped that one day England might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
control the country. Only a European war,
or the serious danger of one that would
defeat France, would cause her now to take
leave. It is the custom of European Governments,
when invading conquerable territory
coveted by others, to protest the temporary
character of their &#8216;mission&#8217;; and if other
proof were needed of the intentions of France
the very constant repetitions of the French
Government that it will adhere to the Act of
Algeciras would tend to rouse suspicion.</p>

<p>But there is reason for the French, indeed
necessity for them, to control Morocco.
Europe is too near Morocco for the country
to be left to anarchy and ignorance and their
consequences. Some European Power or
Powers must represent Europe there, while
the establishment of one other than France
would be a constant menace to Algeria and
would throw upon France the obligation of
devoting to the expense of her colony a
greater outlay than it would cost to conquer
the Moorish Empire. France must remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
in Morocco; and the French&mdash;those soldiers
and diplomatists whom I have seen and
talked with, at any rate&mdash;welcome the
opportunity that the Shawia tribes have
given them, and make the most of it. The
assurances of the French Government are
of course only diplomatic. Assurances of a
temporary occupation were vouchsafed when
Tunis was invaded. Nor is it only France
that follows this diplomacy.</p>

<p>It is for the reason that events threaten
to make permanent a certain French occupation
that a few Britishers would like to
create a difference between France and
Great Britain, to annul the Anglo-French
agreement. For, should France be stopped&mdash;as
she is likely to be without British support&mdash;it
will mean that no country shall regulate
Morocco and that another situation like that
of the Turk in Europe will be established, to
run on an untold term of years. This is
what these partisans would like to bring
about, because their hostility to the French,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
beginning in trade and political rivalry, has
become now one of sentimental sympathy
with the Moors.</p>

<p>The case for Morocco is put by the
Sultan Mulai Hafid himself in an appeal
to the Powers of Europe presented to their
Ministers at Tangier in February (1908).
The argument has the Eastern fault of waiving
rather than undermining the case for France,
as, in one instance, where it speaks of peace
with Europeans in provinces and cities where
there are no foreign troops, a peace that
obtains in the interior because the few European
residents have left, and in the coast towns
because of the lesson of Casablanca. In a
&#8216;free rendering&#8217; of the Arabic original, the
correspondent of the <i>Morning Post</i>, R. L. N.
Johnson, an authority on Morocco and the
author of several literary books pertaining
to the country, interprets this picturesque
document as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8216;In the name of the Most Merciful God,
save from whom is neither device nor might.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
(Here follow the royal seal, the name of the
Foreign Minister addressed, and the customary
salutations.)</p>

<p>&#8216;On behalf of the people of Morocco, one
and all, many of whom are actual sufferers
from what has befallen their dwellings, their
brethren, and their families, I lay before you
my plaint.</p>

<p>&#8216;What has been done to them is an
offence against Treaties and common justice.
He who demands his right has no pretext
for needless, inhuman violence and brutality,
nor is such action compatible with dealings
between the nations. Nor is there wrong
to any (Power) in our nation deposing its
Monarch on reasonable grounds. He has
proved his incapacity, he has neglected every
interest of the State, and he has followed
a line of conduct which would not be tolerated
by the believers of any faith. I call your
attention to the terrible calamity which has
afflicted the people of Morocco, relying upon
your well-known frank recognition of the
truth. Thus you can hardly keep silence on
what has happened and is happening in this
country. From time immemorial your folk
have lived among us, for trade and other
purposes, without any object of filching our
land, exactly as they would live in other
friendly countries, and in the manner laid
down in the Madrid Convention, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
framed upon a knowledge of the conditions
of life in Morocco.</p>

<p>&#8216;It may be you have heard rumours of
a declaration of war (<i>Jehad</i>). That declaration
was made solely with the object of
calming the exasperation of my people at the
wholly unjust invasion of their land and the
occupation of their soil. These invaders are
to-day preventing our people from carrying
on their everyday affairs according to our
time-honoured customs. I was desirous of
appointing Governors in Shawia who should
be responsible to myself for the preservation
of order, but obstacles [the French army&mdash;F.M.]
were placed in my way, and to avoid a
conflict which would have led to terrible
bloodshed I abstained. My one desire is to
restore tranquillity among my people, so as to
bring back general welfare.</p>

<p>&#8216;As to the army now occupying the
Casablanca district on the pretext of pacifying
it and protecting foreigners, this is my duty
towards the whole of Morocco&mdash;that is to
say, to protect both Moslems and Europeans
in their lives and property. I ask nothing
better than to follow the path of justice, that
these troops may evacuate that land and leave
it to its lawful owners. They have but to
depart and no further trouble need be feared.
But assuredly so long as they remain peace is
impossible. You have watched this going on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
for six months. Have you also watched the
conditions of the other provinces and cities
where no other intervention has taken place?
Are not the people, yours and mine, living in
peace and harmony? Absolutely nothing has
occurred to hurt any person or place, nor,
thank God, has any European been molested,
despite all that our brethren have suffered.
The wiser among the French nation recognise
this, without being able to remedy the
mischief done. As to those of lesser understanding
who declare us to be anti-European,
they speak falsely and without a shadow of
reason. Our acts speak for themselves, and
disprove the lies which have been thrown
broadcast over the world. The wise know
this, and that the authors of such calumnies
are monsters rather than human.</p>

<p>&#8216;As for the dethronement of Mulai Abdul
Aziz, this was not only the will of the nation,
but was done by the decision of the lawful
court of Ulema, who judged him. Surely
there is no crime in deposing a Sultan on the
just ground that he is unfit to govern. It
was done not long ago in Turkey. It has
happened among the other Powers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8216;I now ask you to give me a faithful
answer, and I will abide by the truth. On
what principle of international law can there
be armed intervention between a nation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the monarch it has deposed? I wait for
your reply in the firm belief that, on careful
review of the situation, your answer cannot
fail to reflect a bright lustre upon your
judgment and justice.</p>

<p>&#8216;In peace. This 24th Haeja, 1325.&#8217;</p>
</div>

<p>Europeans in Morocco are mostly sympathisers
with Mulai Hafid; and their hopes
for the success of his Holy War lead them
often&mdash;no doubt unconsciously&mdash;to exaggerate
the difficulties of the French and to
enlarge upon the numbers of the tribesmen
opposing them. Though Hafid declared
that his purpose in proclaiming the <i>Jehad</i>
was only to unite the tribes in support of
him, he has been drawn by this proclamation
into war with the French. The forces that
have been recruited by his deception have
either pressed him or have taken upon themselves
to combat the French invasion; and
their opposition would seem to make it
impossible for the French to recognise Hafid
as Sultan. For this would be tantamount to
a defeat of the French in the minds of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
ignorant Moors. On the other hand Hafid&#8217;s
position is now exceedingly difficult; for him
it is either to fight or to surrender to his
brother.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In leaving Morocco it would be picturesque
to say with Pierre Loti: &#8216;Farewell, dark
Moghreb, Empire of the Moors, mayst thou
remain yet many years immured, impenetrable
to the things that are new! Turn thy
back upon Europe! Let thy sleep be the
sleep of centuries, and so continue thine
ancient dream! May Allah preserve to the
Sultan his unsubdued territories and his waste
places carpeted with flowers, there to do
battle as did the Paladins in the old times,
there to gather in his rebel heads! May
Allah preserve to the Arab race its mystic
dreams, its immutability scornful of all things,
and its grey rags; may He preserve to the
Moorish ruins their shrouds of whitewash,
and to the mosques inviolable mystery!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>But for my part there is no sentimental
feeling for Morocco. That a government is
old is no reason, for me, that it should be
maintained. Because the Moors have always
ridden horses, I see no reason why they
should not ride in carriages or even in trains.
In fact, I sympathise with the unfortunate
beasts of burden and with the suffering
Moors themselves. I was not affected, like
the great French writer, more by the beauty
and the romance of the country than by the
horror and distress; and, instead of his fair
sentiment, I say: Let in the French! For the
Moghreb I should like to see a little less of
crime, a little less of base corruption, a little
less of ignorance and needless suffering, a
little less of cruelty, a little less of bestial
vice. The French can do some little for
Morocco, and no other Power can go in.
I say, Let in the French!</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_map.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">
MAP OF<br />
MOROCCO</p>


<p>Yet a last word, to the French: You
boast your knowledge of Mohammedans;
do you know that the Moors dread you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
for what they have heard from their fathers
you did in the early days in Algeria? Nor
have your methods about Casablanca reassured
them. You have slain wantonly,
even under General Drude. General
d&#8217;Amade has penetrated the country time
after time and accomplished &#8216;enormous
slaughter.&#8217; But for what purpose? This
is all unnecessary. It would seem that your
object has been to provoke further hostility,
that you may have excuse to continue your
occupation and to extend it. This is undoubtedly
good politics; but rather unfair to
the ignorant Moors, don&#8217;t you think? And
is it good for your soldiers, Algerians or
Europeans, to use them in this fashion?</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
